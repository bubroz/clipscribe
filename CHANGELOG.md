## [2.14.0] - 2025-06-27 - The Synthesis Update

### 🎯 Major Breakthrough: REBEL Relationship Extraction Fixed

**Critical Bug Resolution**: Fixed the `'NoneType' object is not subscriptable` error that was preventing video processing from completing after successful entity and relationship extraction.

**REBEL Success**: REBEL model is now successfully extracting 10+ relationships per video from news content, including:
- "Pegasus | spyware | instance of"
- "NSO | inception | 2010" 
- "Carmen Aristegui | employer | Aristegui Noticias"
- "United Arab Emirates | diplomatic relation | Saudi Arabia"
- And many more meaningful relationships

### ✨ New Features

#### 1. ✅ Enhanced Temporal Intelligence for Event Timelines (COMPLETE - 2025-06-26 23:23 PDT)
- **LLM-Based Date Extraction**: The timeline synthesis engine now uses an LLM to parse specific dates from video titles and key point descriptions (e.g., "last Tuesday", "in 1945").
- **Sophisticated Fallback Logic**: Implements a robust fallback mechanism. It prioritizes dates from key point content, then from the video title, and finally defaults to the video's publication date.
- **Structured Date Models**: Added a new `ExtractedDate` Pydantic model to store parsed dates, original text, confidence scores, and the source of the extraction.
- **Traceable Timestamps**: The `TimelineEvent` model now includes `extracted_date` and `date_source` fields, providing full traceability for how each event's timestamp was determined.
- **Asynchronous by Design**: The entire timeline synthesis process is now asynchronous to accommodate the new LLM calls without blocking.

#### 2. GEXF 1.3 Upgrade
- **Upgraded GEXF export** from 1.2draft to GEXF 1.3 specification
- Updated XML namespaces and schemas: `http://www.gexf.net/1.3`
- Simplified color definitions using hex attributes for better Gephi compatibility
- Enhanced node styling with confidence-based sizing

#### 3. Knowledge Synthesis Engine
- **Timeline Synthesis**: `_synthesize_event_timeline` method creates chronological timelines from key points across multiple videos
- **Data Models**: Added `TimelineEvent` and `ConsolidatedTimeline` Pydantic models
- **Event Correlation**: Generates unique event IDs and calculates absolute timestamps
- **Multi-Video Intelligence**: Enhanced `MultiVideoIntelligence` with `consolidated_timeline` field

#### 4. Collection Output Management
- **Centralized Output Saving**: `save_collection_outputs` method for consolidated timeline, unified knowledge graph, and full collection intelligence
- **Consistent Directory Naming**: Fixed naming inconsistencies between file saving and reporting
- **Enhanced CLI Integration**: Updated CLI to use centralized collection output saving

### 🐛 Critical Fixes

#### 1. REBEL Relationship Extraction Engine
- **Root Cause Identified**: REBEL model was generating output but parser couldn't read space-separated format
- **Parser Rewrite**: Completely rewrote `_parse_triplets` method in `rebel_extractor.py`
- **Dual Parsing Strategy**: XML tags (fallback) + space-separated format (primary)
- **Debug Logging**: Added comprehensive logging to track extraction process
- **Success Metrics**: Now extracting 14-19 unique relationships per video

#### 2. Async Command Handling
- **RuntimeWarning Fix**: Resolved multiple `coroutine was never awaited` issues
- **CLI Restructure**: Split commands into sync wrappers calling async implementations
- **Proper Async Calls**: Added correct `asyncio.run()` usage throughout CLI

#### 3. File System & Data Integrity
- **Context Field Safety**: Fixed `'NoneType' object is not subscriptable` in relationship CSV saving
- **Directory Consistency**: Corrected naming inconsistencies (title-based vs ID-based paths)
- **Path Generation**: Fixed `create_output_filename` utility for empty extensions
- **Missing Methods**: Added `_extract_key_facts` and `_deduplicate_relationships` methods

#### 4. Logging System Stability
- **Dependency Fix**: Resolved missing loguru dependency by reverting to standard Python logging
- **Environment Support**: Added `CLIPSCRIBE_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` environment variable support
- **Initialization**: Proper `setup_logging()` call in CLI initialization

### 🔧 Technical Improvements

#### 1. Enhanced Error Handling
- **Defensive Programming**: Added multiple safety checks in knowledge graph saving

- **Cost Optimization**: Maintained 92% cost reduction principles

### 🎯 User Experience

#### 1. Success Indicators
- **Relationship Counts**: Clear logging of extracted relationships (e.g., "Extracted 14 unique relationships from 18 total")
- **Knowledge Graph Stats**: "Created knowledge graph: 254 nodes, 9 edges"
- **Processing Feedback**: "Advanced extraction complete: 10 relationships, 271 entities"

#### 2. Output Quality

- **Multi-Video**: Collection processing with cross-video relationship synthesis

### 💡 Development Notes

This release represents a major breakthrough in ClipScribe's relationship extraction capabilities. The REBEL model was working correctly but the parser was incompatible with its output format. The fix enables ClipScribe to extract rich, meaningful relationships that form the foundation for knowledge synthesis across video collections.

**Next Steps**: With relationship extraction now working, v2.15.0 will focus on the Streamlit "Mission Control" UI for managing and visualizing video collections.
