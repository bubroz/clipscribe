# Chimera Researcher Cursor Rules - Optimized Structure

*Last Updated: June 22, 2025 at 05:49 PM PDT*

## 🚀 Optimized Rule System

This rule system has been optimized based on the strategy in `docs/development/rules-optimization-strategy.md`.

### Key Improvements:
1. ✅ **Nested Structure** - Rules organized by category
2. ✅ **Auto-Attachment** - Smart glob patterns for automatic rule loading
3. ✅ **Testing Framework** - Validate rules with `scripts/test_rules.py`
4. ✅ **Better Organization** - Clear separation of concerns

## 📁 Rule Categories

### Core Rules (Always Active)
Located in `core/` - These fundamental rules are always loaded:
- `core-identity.mdc` - Project identity and principles
- `file-organization.mdc` - File structure discipline
- `analytic-tradecraft-sop.mdc` - Intelligence analysis standards
- `critical-files-checklist.mdc` - Important files to update
- `documentation-updates.mdc` - Documentation maintenance
- `documentation-standards.mdc` - Documentation organization

### Feature Rules (Auto-Attached)
Located in `features/` - Load automatically when working on specific features:

#### Intelligence (`features/intelligence/`)
- `intelligence-frameworks.mdc` - Core intelligence doctrines
- `sat-analytics.mdc` - Structured Analytic Techniques
- `prompt-evaluation.mdc` - Prompt testing framework

#### Knowledge Graph (`features/knowledge-graph/`)
- `knowledge-graph-kuzu.mdc` - Kuzu database integration
- `cost-optimized-extraction.mdc` - Entity extraction optimization

#### Monitoring & Reporting (`features/monitoring/`)
- `integrated-reporting.mdc` - Integrated intelligence reports
- `visualization-diagrams.mdc` - Diagram standards

### Platform Rules (Auto-Attached)
Located in `platforms/` - Platform-specific integrations:
- `ai-gemini-integration.mdc` - Gemini 2.5 Pro patterns
- `ai-xai-integration.mdc` - X.AI Live Search patterns

### Development Rules (Context-Specific)
Located in `development/` - Development and deployment patterns:
- `backend-fastapi.mdc` - Python backend patterns
- `frontend-nextjs.mdc` - React/Next.js patterns
- `testing-patterns.mdc` - Testing strategies
- `docker-devops.mdc` - Container and CI/CD
- `security-patterns.mdc` - Security best practices
- `documentation-lifecycle.mdc` - Doc creation process
- `troubleshooting-guide.mdc` - Common issue solutions

## 🎯 How Rules Load

1. **Core Rules** - Always loaded for every file
2. **Auto-Attached Rules** - Load based on file glob patterns
3. **Agent-Requested** - Can be manually invoked with `@ruleName`
4. **Nested Rules** - Load when working in specific feature directories

## 🧪 Testing Your Rules

Run the validation framework:
```bash
python scripts/test_rules.py
```

This will check:
- ✅ Frontmatter validity
- ✅ Glob pattern coverage
- ✅ Rule conflicts
- ✅ Performance impact

## 📊 Rule Metrics

Based on optimization analysis:
- **Total Rules**: 25
- **Auto-Attached**: 16 (with glob patterns)
- **Always Active**: 6 (core rules)
- **Agent-Requested**: 3 (situational)
