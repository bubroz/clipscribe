    "The year 2004 and the release of 'Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge' was the most pivotal period for My Chemical Romance, defining their iconic image and sound.",
    "Lead singer Gerard Way's severe struggles with alcoholism and drug abuse (cocaine) during this era heavily influenced the band's music and his performance.",
    "The death of Gerard and Mikey Way's grandmother in November 2003 caused a significant thematic shift in 'Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge', turning it from a concept album into a more personal exploration of grief and loss.",
    "My Chemical Romance signed with major label Reprise Records, which provided them with a larger budget and better distribution for their sophomore album.",
    "The band acted as a centralizing force in the early 2000s emo and mall goth scene by blending various genres like pop punk, post-hardcore, and metal, which allowed them to appeal to diverse fanbases."
