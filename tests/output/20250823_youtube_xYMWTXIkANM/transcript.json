They suspected it contained numbers selected for potential surveillance with Pegasus. The Pegasus Project reporting consortium \u2014 which was led by Forbidden Stories and included 16 other media organizations, FRONTLINE among them \u2014 found that the spyware had been used on journalists, human rights activists, the wife and fianc\u00e9e of the murdered Saudi columnist Jamal Khashoggi, and others.\n\nOver two parts, this docuseries reveals the inside story of an investigation that prompted probes by governments and institutions around the world and sparked calls for an international treaty to govern the largely unregulated spyware industry.\n\nNSO, which has disputed some of the Pegasus Project\u2019s reporting, says that its technology was not associated in any way with Khashoggi\u2019s murder and that it sells Pegasus to vetted governments for \u201cthe sole purpose of preventing and investigating terror and serious crime.\u201d\n\nPart one of \u201cGlobal Spyware Scandal: Exposing Pegasus\u201d is available to stream here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZVj1_SE4Mo\n\nLearn more: https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/documentary/global-spyware-scandal-exposing-pegasus/\n\n#Documentary #Spyware #Surveillance\n\nFind FRONTLINE on the PBS App, where more than 300 of our documentaries are available to watch any time: https://to.pbs.org/FLVideoApp \nSubscribe on YouTube: http://bit.ly/1BycsJW \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/frontlinepbs \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/frontlinepbs \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/frontline \n\n\u201cGlobal Spyware Scandal: Exposing Pegasus\u201d is a FRONTLINE production with Forbidden Films.

    "full_text": "Pegasus. Pegasus. Pegasus. In collaboration with Forbidden Films, a two-part investigation. This story would be huge. NSO was established with the ambition to make the world a safer place into powerful spyware. It's a military weapon used against citizens, used around the world. There is no control over how countries use it, and they have been using it in the worst way you could imagine. Now on Frontline, part two of Global Spyware scandal, exposing Pegasus.\n\nWhen you have your hands on a technology like this, the power must be quite intoxicating.\n\nYou can get into the phone of most people in the world.\n\nAnd no one's looking over your shoulder.\n\nOn va se faire un brief.\n\nLa base de donn\u00e9es est vraiment explosive.\n\nPegasus. Pegasus. Pegasus. Pegasus.\nIt's like a person over your shoulder. A person who will see what you are seeing, a person who will watch what you are watching, your emails, your encrypted communication, everything. So once you are infected, you're trapped.\n\nIt was against so many people in civil society who clearly were not terrorists or criminals. And you got a real sense that it was a free-for-all.\n\nDe acuerdo con la pesquisa recabada por The Washington Post, The Guardian, Le Monde y otros medios. The joint investigation by 17 news outlets and Forbidden... Activists, lawyers and journalists are reportedly among those who've been targeted by the phone spyware. phone numbers belonging to some big-name politicians... una lista de celulares... \u6211\u5bb6\u9886\u8896\u3001\u7687\u5ba4\u6210\u5458\u3001\u653f\u5546\u8981\u5458\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u8bb0\u8005\u7684\u624b\u673a\u3002 NSO says they sell the software to governments for legitimate purposes, fighting terrorism or violating local laws.\nYou have here a go-to spy service for tyrants. terrorism or violating local laws. You have here a go-to spy service for tyrants. When we started analyzing the list, we saw a lot of French numbers. More than 1,000 potentially targeted by Morocco. There were journalists, lawyers, activists, but not only. We also saw members of the French government and the President Macron himself. We immediately realized that this story would be huge. Alors, je vous explique juste peut-\u00eatre. Donc \u00e7a c'est \u00e7a c'est le num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, \u00e7a c'est dans la base de donn\u00e9es. Ouais. Oh! \u00c9douard Philippe. \u00c9douard... Oh la la la la. Oh, G\u00e9rald Darmanin. Ah le Drian. Ah bah, aussi. Oh l\u00e0 l\u00e0, mais il y a vraiment tout le monde quoi. C'est un truc de malade. La question, \u00e7a va plus \u00eatre... voil\u00e0, c'est \u00e7a, qui est-ce qu'ils ont rat\u00e9 ? Allez, Julien de Normandie. We knew politicians were on the list, and to prove that there had actually been infected with Pegasus, we needed their phones, but politicians wouldn't hand you their phone that easily, specifically if you're an investigative journalist. Oui oui. Apr\u00e8s, je comprends tout \u00e0 fait si vous souhaitez pas le, pas le faire. C'est bien entendu votre droit le plus strict. Au revoir. Je pense qu'il va dire non lui. Il se trouve que parmi les personnes qui figurent dans la liste, il y a un ancien ministre qui n'est plus au gouvernement et qui donc a une une forme de libert\u00e9 un peu plus grande que quelqu'un qui serait encore actuellement au pouvoir et c'est Fran\u00e7ois de Rugy. Donc on a contact\u00e9 Fran\u00e7ois de Rugy en lui expliquant qu'on souhaitait lui parler de quelque chose d'extr\u00eamement confidentiel. Vous n'\u00eates pas le seul ministre ou ex-ministre concern\u00e9, on en a au total 14. Et donc \u00e0 son cr\u00e9dit, il a il a fini par accepter, et donc on on s'est... au total 14. Et donc \u00e0 son cr\u00e9dit, il a il a fini par accepter et donc on on s'est revu pour proc\u00e9der \u00e0 \u00e0 l'analyse technique de de son t\u00e9l\u00e9phone et qui nous a permis de confirmer qu'effectivement, il avait bien \u00e9t\u00e9 cibl\u00e9 et qu'il avait bien \u00e9t\u00e9 cibl\u00e9 par le client qu'on avait identifi\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant le Royaume du Maroc. Il a pas eu l'air du tout surpris quand je lui ai annonc\u00e9 le pays. Ah bon ? Il me dit qu'il a rencontr\u00e9 le roi. Ce qui est une bonne mani\u00e8re de te mettre sur les radars de ces gens. Le num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone qui est attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 Emmanuel Macron, la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape \u00e7a a \u00e9t\u00e9 de v\u00e9rifier que le num\u00e9ro \u00e9tait encore actif aujourd'hui et que c'\u00e9tait bien toujours Emmanuel Macron qui l'utilisait. Et donc le moyen le plus simple de v\u00e9rifier si il l'utilise toujours, c'est de lui \u00e9crire. Donc en fait, on va envoyer un SMS \u00e0 Emmanuel Macron. Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident de la R\u00e9publique, Nous publions une enqu\u00eate internationale sur la cybersurveillance. Hmm hmm. Dont vous-m\u00eame avez \u00e9t\u00e9 la cible. Dont vous-m\u00eame avez \u00e9t\u00e9 la cible. C'est plus clair, soyons clairs. En plus, c'est pour \u00e7a. C'est \u00e7a que vous allez lui dire. Ah bah oui oui. Dont vous avez \u00e9t\u00e9 la cible. C'est parti. Et donc Emmanuel Macron ne r\u00e9pond pas directement \u00e0 ce SMS, mais une heure ou deux heures apr\u00e8s avoir envoy\u00e9 ce SMS, les services de l'\u00c9lys\u00e9e nous rappellent \u00e0 propos du SMS qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9. Donc il l'a bien re\u00e7u. Le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone est toujours actif. Ouais ouais, ben l\u00e0 on va \u00e0 l'\u00c9lys\u00e9e l\u00e0. Quelques heures apr\u00e8s avoir envoy\u00e9 ce SMS \u00e0 Emmanuel Macron, on a re\u00e7u une invitation \u00e0 se rendre \u00e0 l'\u00c9lys\u00e9e qui venait des services de l'\u00c9tat pour discuter ce que nous avions trouv\u00e9. Pyramide. le rendez-vous quand m\u00eame de ce matin, l'impression que \u00e7a nous a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 tous, c'\u00e9tait vraiment le c\u00f4t\u00e9 panique. Enfin pas panique genre \"Oh mon dieu, c'est horrible ce qui a pu se passer\", mais c'est plut\u00f4t \"Oh mon Dieu, toutes les implications potentielles de cette affaire sur tous les plans judiciaires, diplomatiques, s\u00e9curitaires voil\u00e0 et que et que en fait, ils verrouillent ils verrouillent la la communication. Assez rapidement, les experts de l'\u00c9tat vont confirmer qu'il y a bien eu des tentatives d'infection ou des infections dans certains cas sur les t\u00e9l\u00e9phones de certains ministres euh et sur les t\u00e9l\u00e9phones d'un certain nombre de tr\u00e8s hauts fonctionnaires euh fran\u00e7ais. Le r\u00e9sultat des analyses du t\u00e9l\u00e9phone du pr\u00e9sident de la R\u00e9publique est class\u00e9 secret d\u00e9fense et on y aura vraisemblablement jamais acc\u00e8s. euh fran\u00e7ais. Le r\u00e9sultat des analyses du t\u00e9l\u00e9phone du pr\u00e9sident de la R\u00e9publique est class\u00e9 secret d\u00e9fense et on n'y aura vraisemblablement jamais acc\u00e8s. We don't know exactly who in Morocco was using Pegasus. There were Moroccan dissidents on the list, even the king of Morocco himself was on the list, but we do know that NSO only sells to governments and government agencies. We were reaching out to another dimension of the project. We were at this stage entering a space, a dangerous space where we were talking about a country, a state attacking another one. Each time you look at how a client of NSO Group used the technology, it tells you something about that government. In the UAE, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum is Prime Minister, Vice President, and of course the ruler of Dubai. Here is an autocratic leader, massively powerful. Princess Latifa is the daughter of Sheikh Mohammed. She had for a long time been by her account unhappy about her life in Dubai. She had been uh, incarcerated effectively by her father's regime. I'm making this video because it could be the last video I make. Yeah. This video can help me because all my father cares about is his reputation. He will kill people to protect his own reputation. He he he only cares about himself and his ego. Princess Latifa concocted this extraordinary attempted escape that involved jet skis, a yacht, and a trip to the Indian Ocean. I mean, it's an audacious thing to do. Incredible even that she attempted it. I think remarkable that it nearly succeeded. The day after Princess Latifa went missing from Dubai, we saw her number entered into the list. And in the days after that, as she was traveling toward India, went missing from Dubai, we saw her number entered into the list. And in the days after that, as she was traveling toward India on this yacht, her friends, people she knew, people within her orbit, their phone numbers also appeared on the list.\n\nIf you look at the dates and times that her number and those of people close to her were entered into the system, you have something that has to be more than a coincidence.\n\nEight days after her escape, Indian special forces boarded the yacht, and then the princess was forcibly returned to Dubai.\n\nWe don't know exactly why the attempted escape didn't succeed, but NSO's technology was, it seems from the evidence we've seen, you know, one of the tools that was being used by the state in a desperate attempt to find Princess Latifa, kidnap her, and return her back to Dubai.\n\nWe tried hard to get hold of a phone that Latifa had used, but we couldn't. So we contacted her friends and her associates to ask if we could check their phones to see if they had been targeted with Pegasus.\n\nGiven how much David Haigh was working on the Latifa case, it wasn't a surprise when we discovered that there was Pegasus activity on his phone.\n\nI was infected on the 3rd of August 2020 with Pegasus. I believe at 3:00 a.m. in the morning and the next day as well.\n\nThe fact that you can be hacked on British soil and that they can do that, it's frightening. It really is.\n\nMy name is David Haigh from Detained International. Then we founded the campaign to free the Dubai princess, Princess Latifa in 2018.\n\nDavid Hay was actually imprisoned in Dubai for alleged fraud, and it was after his release that he became a human rights campaigner.\n\nPrincess Latifa began to message him after her failed attempted escape.\n\nThis is a picture that Latifa drew of the jail villa, Villa 96 in Jumeirah, Dubai, near the Burj Al Arab. Um and you can see here beach this direction where she was held captive.\n\nThis villa has been converted into a jail. All the windows are barred shut. I can't open any window. Uh, there's five policemen outside and two police women inside the house. Uh, I don't know what can happen to me and how long this will last and if they decide to release me, is five policemen outside and two policewoman inside the house. Uh I don't know what can happen to me and how long this will last and if they decide to release me, like how my life will be. But um I'm not safe at all.\nThat week before I'd hacked, our secret contact with Latifa had stopped suddenly.\nThe several hours became a day, and then two days.\nAnd then we started to worry because that was not normal.\nWe had recorded a lot of videos and a lot of evidence Latifa had that could be used to tell the world about her predicament, the fact that she's been held hostage.\nAt the time I was hacked, we were in London with the videos that Latifa recorded, the evidence to meet media to decide if we were going to use it at that time or not.\nIt was effectively dynamite evidence on that phone.\nThe fact that they know your location,\nthat someone could be listening to us now and seeing what we're doing.\nAnd it's that sitting in the back of your head every day.\nWe can't let NSO and the governments that abuse their system get away with what they've done. Because if we do, and if nothing happens and people are not brought to justice, people are not put in jail, and people are not taken to court, the next company and the next company and the next company, wherever they may be, will do exactly the same.\nAnd it will just carry on but get worse.\n\u05dc\u05d9\u05d1\u05d4 \u05e9\u05dc \u05d4\u05d7\u05d1\u05e8\u05d4, \u05d6\u05d4 \u05de\u05d4 \u05e9\u05d0\u05e0\u05d7\u05e0\u05d5 \u05e7\u05d5\u05e8\u05d0\u05d9\u05dd \u05dc\u05d5 \u05d7\u05d5\u05e7\u05e8\u05d9 \u05d7\u05d5\u05dc\u05e9\u05d5\u05ea.\n\u05d0\u05ea\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d5\u05e7\u05d7 \u05de\u05e2\u05e8\u05db\u05ea \u05db\u05de\u05d5 \u05d4\u05d0\u05d9\u05d9\u05e4\u05d5\u05df, \u05e9\u05e2\u05d1\u05d3\u05d5 \u05e2\u05dc \u05d6\u05d4 \u05d4\u05de\u05d4\u05e0\u05d3\u05e1\u05d9\u05dd \u05d4\u05d8\u05d5\u05d1\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd, \u05d5\u05d0\u05ea\u05d4 \u05de\u05d5\u05e6\u05d0 \u05d3\u05e8\u05da \u05dc\u05d4\u05ea\u05d2\u05d1\u05e8 \u05e2\u05dc \u05d6\u05d4.\n\u05d0\u05d1\u05dc \u05d9\u05e9 \u05de\u05e0\u05d2\u05e0\u05d5\u05df \u05d3\u05d9 \u05de\u05e9\u05d5\u05de\u05df \u05e9\u05dc \u05d2\u05d9\u05d5\u05e1 \u05d9\u05d5\u05e6\u05d0\u05d9 \u05d9\u05d7\u05d9\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05de\u05d7\u05e9\u05d1\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05e6\u05d1\u05d0 \u05dc\u05d4\u05d9\u05d9\u05d8\u05e7 \u05d4\u05d0\u05d6\u05e8\u05d7\u05d9, \u05dc\u05db\u05dc \u05de\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9 \u05dc\u05db\u05dc \u05de\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d7\u05d1\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea.\n\u05e9\u05de\u05d5\u05e0\u05d4 \u05de\u05d0\u05ea\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd, \u05d9\u05d7\u05d9\u05d3\u05d4 \u05d2\u05d3\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4 \u05d1\u05ea\u05d5\u05da \u05d4\u05e6\u05d1\u05d0. \u05e6\u05d1\u05d0, \u05dc\u05d4\u05d9\u05d9\u05d8\u05e7 \u05d4\u05d0\u05d6\u05e8\u05d7\u05d9, \u05dc\u05db\u05dc \u05de\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9, \u05dc\u05db\u05dc \u05de\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d7\u05d1\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea. 8200 \u05d4\u05d9\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d7\u05d9\u05d3\u05d4 \u05d2\u05d3\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4 \u05d1\u05ea\u05d5\u05da \u05d4\u05e6\u05d1\u05d0. \u05d5\u05d1\u05ea\u05d5\u05da \u05d4\u05d9\u05d7\u05d9\u05d3\u05d4 \u05d4\u05d6\u05d0\u05ea\u05d9 \u05e2\u05d5\u05e1\u05e7\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05e1\u05d9\u05d9\u05d1\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d4\u05ea\u05e7\u05e4\u05d9 \u05e9\u05dc \u05e6\u05d1\u05d0 \u05d4\u05d2\u05e0\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc, \u05e9\u05dc \u05e6\u05d4\"\u05dc. \u05db\u05e9\u05e6\u05e8\u05d9\u05db\u05d9\u05dd \u05dc\u05d4\u05d5\u05e6\u05d9\u05d0 \u05de\u05d9\u05d3\u05e2 \u05de\u05d4\u05d0\u05d5\u05d9\u05d1\u05d9\u05dd \u05e9\u05dc\u05e0\u05d5, \u05d6\u05d4 \u05d0\u05e0\u05e9\u05d9\u05dd \u05e9\u05d9\u05e2\u05e9\u05d5 \u05d0\u05ea \u05d6\u05d4. \u05d9\u05e9 \u05dc\u05d4\u05dd \u05d9\u05d3\u05e2 \u05e9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d0 \u05e0\u05d3\u05d9\u05e8. \u05dc\u05d5\u05e7\u05d7\u05d9\u05dd \u05d9\u05dc\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05e0\u05d9 18, \u05de\u05db\u05e9\u05d9\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05d0\u05d5\u05ea\u05dd \u05de\u05d0\u05d5\u05d3 \u05de\u05d4\u05e8 \u05d5\u05de\u05d0\u05d5\u05d3 \u05dc\u05e2\u05d5\u05de\u05e7. Israel has this advantage of not only developing new technologies and weaponry, but testing it live. And this is something Israel knows it can use to sell outside. When you want to control a huge population, like we do with Palestinians, you have to have assets everywhere. So, everyone could be a target because you don't want only the, I don't know, terrorist from Hamas, but also maybe his neighbor or the his cousin or the person who sells milk in the corner of the street. If you want to recruit human agents, you need to collect their weaknesses, things that you can use to blackmail. And so, part of what 8200 does is to collect this blackmail potential information about everybody. If you're gay or if you have medical, special medical condition or you have financial problems or someone from your family has one of those, then that's something we can use against you to blackmail you and get you to cooperate. Israeli intelligence has a strategic view of how their employees should be used after they leave their employ. They promote them, they want them to start these companies, and they see a deep communications, a continued relationship between the government and their former employees as valuable to Israel's national security interests. There's a lot of evidence to suggest that NSO Group had the the direct backing and support of BB Netanyahu's government. In order to sell its product to governments around the world, it required permits, effectively licenses from the Israeli Defense Ministry.\nI decided several years ago to turn Israel into one of the five uh cyber powers of the world.\nIn order for the companies to develop, they need to make, what do they need to make?\nMoney.\nThey need to make money.\nNow, the easiest way to make sure that they don't make money is one, high taxes, right?\nWhat's the other one?\nRegulations.\nHave you ever heard of regulations?\nWe have a problem with regulations.\nSo the policy we have is keep taxes low\nand keep regulations low.\nMinimize regulations.\nThere is no industry more susceptible and more inviting of regulations than cyber security.\nIt's like weapons.\nIt is a weapon.\n\u05d4\u05e1\u05d9\u05e4\u05d5\u05e8 \u05e9\u05dc \u05e9\u05d9\u05de\u05d5\u05e9\n\u05d1\u05e0\u05e9\u05e7\n\u05db\u05d0\u05de\u05e6\u05e2\u05d9 \u05d3\u05d9\u05e4\u05dc\u05d5\u05de\u05d8\u05d9\n\u05d4\u05d5\u05d0 \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d7\u05d3\u05e9 \u05d1\u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc.\n\u05d9\u05e9 \u05dc\u05d6\u05d4 \u05d0\u05e4\u05d9\u05dc\u05d5 \u05de\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5\u05d7. \u05e7\u05d5\u05e8\u05d0\u05d9\u05dd \u05dc\u05d6\u05d4 \u05d3\u05d9\u05e4\u05dc\u05d5\u05de\u05d8\u05d9\u05d9\u05ea \u05d4\u05e2\u05d5\u05d6\u05d9.\n\u05d5\u05de\u05e6\u05d0\u05e0\u05d5 \u05de\u05ea\u05d0\u05dd \u05d1\u05d9\u05df\n\u05dc\u05d5\u05d7 \u05d4\u05d6\u05de\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd,\n\u05d1\u05d9\u05df \u05d1\u05d9\u05e7\u05d5\u05e8 \u05e9\u05dc \u05e0\u05ea\u05e0\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5 \u05d1\u05de\u05d3\u05d9\u05e0\u05d4 \u05de\u05e1\u05d5\u05d9\u05de\u05ea \u05d0\u05d5 \u05d1\u05d9\u05e7\u05d5\u05e8 \u05e9\u05dc \u05de\u05e0\u05d4\u05d9\u05d2 \u05de\u05d3\u05d9\u05e0\u05d4 \u05d0\u05d7\u05e8\u05ea \u05d1\u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc\n\u05d5\u05d4\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05e9\u05d1\u05d5 \u05d4\u05d5\u05e4\u05e2\u05dc\u05d4 \u05dc\u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d5\u05e0\u05d4\n\u05de\u05e2\u05e8\u05db\u05ea NSO \u05d1\u05d0\u05d5\u05ea\u05d4 \u05de\u05d3\u05d9\u05e0\u05d4.\n\u05d0\u05d4, \u05dc\u05e4\u05e2\u05de\u05d9\u05dd\n\u05d4\u05e4\u05e2\u05dc\u05ea \u05d4\u05de\u05e2\u05e8\u05db\u05ea \u05e7\u05d3\u05de\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d1\u05d9\u05e7\u05d5\u05e8 \u05d4\u05de\u05d3\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9, \u05dc\u05e4\u05e2\u05de\u05d9\u05dd \u05d4\u05d1\u05d9\u05e7\u05d5\u05e8 \u05d4\u05de\u05d3\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9 \u05e7\u05d3\u05dd \u05dc\u05d4\u05e4\u05e2\u05dc\u05ea \u05d4\u05de\u05e2\u05e8\u05db\u05ea,\n\u05d0\u05d1\u05dc \u05e7\u05d5\u05e8\u05dc\u05e6\u05d9\u05d4 \u05d4\u05d9\u05d9\u05ea\u05d4 \u05db\u05d6\u05d0\u05ea\u05d9 \u05e9\u05d0\u05d9 \u05d0\u05e4\u05e9\u05e8 \u05dc\u05d4\u05ea\u05e2\u05dc\u05dd \u05de\u05de\u05e0\u05d4.\n\u05d3\u05d5\u05d2\u05de\u05d4 \u05d0\u05d7\u05ea \u05d4\u05d9\u05d0 \u05d4\u05d5\u05e0\u05d2\u05e8\u05d9\u05d4,\n\u05e9\u05ea\u05d7\u05ea \u05e8\u05d0\u05e9 \u05d4\u05de\u05de\u05e9\u05dc\u05d4 \u05d4\u05e4\u05d5\u05e4\u05d5\u05dc\u05d9\u05e1\u05d8 \u05d5\u05d9\u05e7\u05d8\u05d5\u05e8 \u05d0\u05d5\u05e8\u05d1\u05df,\n\u05d4\u05de\u05d3\u05d9\u05e0\u05d4 \u05d4\u05e4\u05db\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d4\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea \u05d0\u05d7\u05ea \u05de\u05d1\u05e2\u05dc\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea \u05d4\u05d7\u05d6\u05e7\u05d5\u05ea \u05e9\u05dc \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc \u05d1\u05d0\u05d9\u05d7\u05d5\u05d3 \u05d4\u05d0\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05e4\u05d9.\nThe timeline for Hungary is that the visit was in July 2017\nand uh the operation of Hungary we know almost the exact date\nby the database of Forbidden Stories.

Going through all the numbers on the list was a huge job. More than 15,000 of the numbers were in Mexico and one of those numbers belonged to a journalist who was murdered just weeks after he was put on the list. Was Pegasus used in that case to spy on a journalist or to geolocate him? Sabes que Cecilio Pineda est\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n en la lista? S\u00ed? El el que el que fue asesinado? S\u00ed. Est\u00e1 en la lista, s\u00ed. Uf. Qu\u00e9 fuerte. En M\u00e9xico es muy grave que se haya usado Pegasus como se us\u00f3. Me remito al caso de Cecilio Pineda, y de Pegasus Project lo mostr\u00f3 p\u00fablicamente, que su tel\u00e9fono fue ingresado d\u00edas antes o semanas antes de haber sido cometido el asesinato.\nEl estado de Guerrero es una de las entidades m\u00e1s impactadas por el crimen organizado. Hay lugares en donde literalmente el Estado ya no tiene dominio. Las autoridades en realidad est\u00e1n pues mezcladas con el crimen organizado. Y hay pues actividad del del narcotr\u00e1fico, hay actividad diversa delincuencial.\nDe acuerdo con el reporte de la polic\u00eda, varios sujetos armados llegaron a un autolavado donde el periodista Cecilio Pineda esperaba que le entregaran su camioneta y le dispararon.\nNo me sorprende que Cecilio Pineda estuviera en esa lista, porque el tema que se estaba tocando era serio.\nPues que la neta, no, ya estamos cansados de violencia, pero nadie eh tiene segura su vida. Tambi\u00e9n es verdad, vivimos en una regi\u00f3n donde estamos solos, en una regi\u00f3n en donde todas las autoridades pues no te no te apoyan y aqu\u00ed uno tiene que defenderse con sus propias u\u00f1as.\nBuenas tardes, amigos de Tierra Caliente. Pues aqu\u00ed ya de regreso despu\u00e9s de estar en dos municipios de la regi\u00f3n y pues nos encontramos con esto.\nA Cecilio te vecho un video. Ven\u00eda en camino y quiso dar un mensaje anticipado de lo que iba a presentar despu\u00e9s.\n\u00c9l dijo que eh unas horas despu\u00e9s iba a mostrar el video de la relaci\u00f3n que hab\u00eda entre el gobierno del Estado y el grupo del Tequilero. Despu\u00e9s de eso ya no present\u00f3 nada, a \u00e9l lo asesinaron.\nEse d\u00eda este,\nY ya al llegar a la cl\u00ednica, este, yo quise pasar a verlo. Entonces me dice la se\u00f1orita, se\u00f1or, se lo est\u00e1n atendiendo. Entonces yo pens\u00e9 pues que iba a estar bien. Dije, no, pues nada m\u00e1s fue pues algo.\nYa como a los a los 3 minutos sale. que sepas que ibas a estar bien. Dije, no, pues nada m\u00e1s fue pues algo. Ya como a los, a los 3 minutos sale el doctor. Dice, no, dice, pues ya ya falleci\u00f3. Y es la \u00fanica vez en mi vida que que me he desmayado. Y cuando volv\u00ed pues estaba toda aturdida, dije, pues no sab\u00eda que y pues ya fue cuando me volvi\u00f3 a decir pues que ya hab\u00eda fallecido. que este que que ya hab\u00eda llegado pr\u00e1cticamente casi muerto pues. You can only prove infection if you do forensics on the phone and find traces of Pegasus. But in many cases, the phone was not findable. That was the case of Cecilio Pineda. no se puede afirmar categ\u00f3ricamente que lo que se obtuvo de el posible espionaje haya sido lo que provoc\u00f3 el asesinato. Pero tampoco podemos ser ingenuos. We were able to set up a date where we all agreed that will be the day of the publication. in 2021, July 18th. We knew that the most dangerous phase was those two weeks before the publication. when you knock on the door of the NSO group to say, hey, we have forbidden stories. We are 80 reporters. We investigate your businesses and we have evidence of a global misuse that is threatening democracy. On rentre dans la phase un peu d'inconnu, peut-\u00eatre que en face il va y avoir une vraie strat\u00e9gie pour discr\u00e9diter tout ce qu'on a fait. They can blackmail the source. They can hack me, one of the person of the team. They can follow us. They can come into our offices. By now, the members of the consortium had managed to do forensics on over 60 phones connected to numbers on the list, and we had forensic proof that at least 37 phones members of the consortium had managed to do forensics on over 60 phones connected to numbers on the list. And we had forensic proof that at least 37 phones had been targeted or infected with Pegasus. The more publication day was approaching, the more paranoid we all became. Before publication, we already had that habit to switching off the phones or even our computers before having any conversation about the investigation. So most of the day we were living and working without our phones or even our computers. So we had different ways of working. We had other devices we could work on. Et il faut s'attendre \u00e0 \u00e7a. Il faut s'attendre \u00e0 ce que m\u00eame nos partenaires aient des r\u00e9serves parce que NSO les aura approch\u00e9s ou des proches de NSO les auront approch\u00e9s pour leur dire que, en fait, on s'est tromp\u00e9. I remember that day clicking on the button send. I was sending the official request for comment from the 80 reporters with dozens of questions inside. We were giving a deadline to the NSO group and to all the state actors. And we were expecting some answers. Hello. This is Laurent Richard from Forbidden Stories. How are you doing? Yeah, I'm good. I'm Yeah, thank you for taking the time to to answer. Uh, I was just wondering if you are planning to answer our question. Yeah, you can see it in your email now. Yeah. Okay, I see it. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Okay. What we got is an email from the NSO group saying that all you think is wrong. Thank you, best regards. NSO group firmly denies false claims made in your report, which many of them are uncorroborated theories that raise serious doubts about the reliability of your sources as well as the basis of your story. Euh, c'est incroyable. C'est dingue. But then when I woke up in the next morning, I opened my phone and I saw that NSO had sent letters from lawyers to most of the partners on all continents to threaten them and to tell them that if you publish anything, we will sue you. send letters from lawyers to most of the partners on all continents to threaten them and to tell them that if you publish anything, we will sue you.\n\nIt's a bit tense here if I'm honest.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nUm, we've had a provisional response from NSO to the Washington Post. Um, and we will have the formal, another response from them to us in about\n15, 20 minutes, so we're going to keep this call really quick.\nUm, the stakes are really high when you do this kind of reporting.\nHere was a company valued at over a billion dollars.\nAnd the NSO group and its clients, these governments, were not going to put their hands up and confess to this activity. They were fighting it as hard as they possibly could.\nAll going well, if we're proceeding with this project, I think the crunch point really is going to be in the next 12 hours.\nWhat do you mean in the sense of if we are proceeding, Paul?\nYeah.\nIs that in doubt?\nWell, it's all it's it's it's never it's never confirmed until it's confirmed, right?\n\nWe can confirm at least, au moins trois noms de votre enqu\u00eate. Emmanuel Macron, King Mohammed VI and Tedros Ghebreyesus ne sont pas et n'ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 des cibles ou s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9es comme cibles par des clients de NSO Group.\n\nYes. Ouais, on a une qui demande nomm\u00e9ment pour euh euh le PR, euh Mohamed 6 et le mec de l'OMS. Ah. Je je suis en route pour le bureau de la direction. \u00c0 tout de suite.\n\nEn mars 2019, alors que le pr\u00e9sident Macron suit de tr\u00e8s pr\u00e8s la crise politique qui secoue l'Alg\u00e9rie, c'est \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 que l'un de ses num\u00e9ros est enregistr\u00e9 par un service marocain.\nSo Paul, just so we're 100% clear, you guys are ready to hit the button on a version of the story in 42 minutes.\nOf the heads of state story.\nHeads of state only.\nWe're not ready now, but in 42 minutes, we will be ready. in 42 minutes. Of the Heads of State story Heads of State only. We're not ready now, but in 42 minutes, we will be ready. But here we were simultaneously publishing 17 different media outlets all over the world in several different languages all at the same time on the same minute, on the same day after months of investigating. An investigation into the NSO. No this? That's okay. I'd just say yeah and it's C. Let's. Thank you. Z\u00e9ro, c'est parti. Allez Putain Actif! 18 On est bon, 18. So the story's now live. An explosive investigation from the Washington Post and a consortium of media partners. Activists, lawyers and journalists are reportedly among those de varios medios revel\u00f3 una lista de de la utilizaci\u00f3n de Pegasus en el mundo l'Elys\u00e9e prend cette affaire avec beaucoup de s\u00e9rieux. Il faut pas que les choses retombent dans quelques jours. Pegasus est utilis\u00e9 par des \u00e9tats pour cibler des journalistes, des politiques et m\u00eame des chefs d'\u00e9tat. What can be done to protect our country from commercial spyware? The kind of threat that is now being reported at the top of the news across the nation. There had been reporters who've been doing stories on Pegasus for years. This sort of tipped the scale because it was in so many countries. It was against so many people in civil society who clearly were not terrorists or criminals. And you got a real sense that it was an it was a free for all. We even found out afterwards that the FBI considered using a version of Pegasus that could hack into US phones. But that fell apart and the Biden administration actually blacklisted NSO Group. They've made a bigger deal than I would have expected against not just an Israeli company but really they're criticizing the Israeli government for allowing this to happen because it actually could not happen without the Israeli government's permission. You have here a go-to spy service for tyrants. What the executives of these companies and the engineers are hoping for most is to make a whole lot of money. what the executives of these companies and the engineers are hoping for most is to make a whole lot of money and do it in a way where there's minimal regulation and minimal oversight.\nA U.S. Appeals Court is allowing WhatsApp messaging service to move forward with a lawsuit against NSO Group over allegedly targeting\nSilicon Valley has a big role to play. Company like WhatsApp, company like Apple, they are suing NSO. They are the ones with money, they are the ones who promise you safety and security.\nAll we've seen NSO group is deny, deny, deny, and that's shown up entirely through the legal process as well.\nThe way I think about it is tech companies can and should do everything they can to make their software as secure as possible. But at the end of the day, if there's no consequences for people who try to break that software to commit human rights abuses, then there will always be people trying to do it. It's just like the only solution to stopping bank robbery is not to have the best technology in banks. Yes, you do that too. It's also that bank robbers get caught and have consequences for trying to to rob banks. And we need that for the spyware industry.\nPegasus spyware is once again back in the spotlight. This time for targeting pro-independence supporters in Spain's Catalonia. Several members of Poland's opposition have produced evidence they were hacked by Pegasus. This scandal is being dubbed the Polish Watergate.\nIn Europe, we were discovering new victims of the spyware, and new countries were accused of using Pegasus to spy on their opponents.\nAt the European Parliament, representatives from NSO agreed to answer questions from politicians. It was the first time they'd done this.\nIch bin Hannah Neumann, Mitglied des Europ\u00e4ischen Parlaments.\nUnd ich bin stellvertretende Vorsitzende des Menschenrechtsausschusses.\nEs war schon ein langer Weg zu diesem Untersuchungsausschuss zu kommen.\nDie zentrale Herausforderung wird sein, wie stark kooperieren diese Akteure mit uns.\nWe know that NSO is now on the market, so maybe they are trying to polish their image. That would be interesting to see. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. On behalf of NSO, I want to thank the members of the committee of inquiry for having us here today. Before we begin, we should note that there are limits to the information we can share with the committee and others. As you know, NSO is a private company providing export-controlled cyber intelligence technologies only and exclusive to government agencies for the purpose of preventing and investigating terrorism and other serious crimes. As a result, we are unable to share details about our customers, as well as the crimes prevented and criminals tracked and apprehended using our technologies or trade secrets of the technology. It is not true that NSO Group operates Pegasus and collects information about individuals. It is not true that NSO Group sells its technology to private companies. The issues that came up about, uh, Jamal Khashoggi, about President Macron, the system was not used on those numbers. I will go immediately into the Q&A session of today's meeting. We already have about 15 members who have asked for the floor. Have you ever terminated a contract with an EU member state? We have terminated contracts with the EU member states, but to get into again the exact numbers... That's fine. Thank you. Next question. If a country does not give you a permission to audit, is that a reason for you to terminate a contract, yes or no? As stated before, if they do not allow us to do the audit and do not participate in the provide us with the information we need in our investigation, yes, that is a reason to terminate a contract. I can state with that we've terminated eight customers over the past several years. Have United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia ever gone through your due diligence check and have they passed it? As I said, I'm not going to respond to questions regarding specific potential customers. Given that UAE and Saudi Arabia have been using Pegasus software, who are legitimate actors to issue warrants in these countries according to your checks? Again, I repeat it again. I'm not going to respond to questions regarding specific customers. Yes, I hear. Witam Pana. Witam Pana. Jestem z Polski.

I cannot, and again I repeat, I cannot because of various confidentiality and secrecy issues. I cannot get into specific questions regarding specific customers or specific cases. Ezek a p csatban lenn\u00e9nek azok a k\u00e9rd\u00e9seim, hogy van-e m\u00e9g tov\u00e1bbra is \u00e9l\u0151 szerz\u0151d\u00e9s\u00fck a magyar korm\u00e1nnyal.

First of all, every customer that we sell to goes through the due diligence review in advance. And if and very often if concerns are raised regarding the rule of law, because what we're looking at is also rule of law, and any country that we've decided to sell to has has been approved in the please please stop the stop the storytelling. I'm going to continue in Hungarian. Direkten mondom Magyarorsz\u00e1g p\u00e9ld\u00e1t, teh\u00e1t hogy folyamatosan el\u00edt\u00e9lnek egy tag\u00e1llamot k\u00fcl\u00f6nb\u00f6z\u0151 jog\u00e1llamis\u00e1gi krit\u00e9riumok alapj\u00e1n, akkor \u00f6n\u00f6k sz\u00e1m\u00e1ra az mi\u00e9rt jelent biztons\u00e1gos orsz\u00e1got, mi\u00e9rt jelent \u00f6n\u00f6k sz\u00e1m\u00e1ra garanci\u00e1t?

I I have not said we have not said that we have determined recently that Hungary is or is not a secure country. You did consider it secure because you sold the stuff to them. Excuse me, excuse me, colleague, excuse me. I said now Let's let's keep a little bit of order in the meeting as well. I understand there is frustration, but you have the concrete question, we have a concrete answer, and please... So you keep repeating the same thing, and there seems to be a complete disconnect between reality and between what you're saying. This is like, you know, it's an insult to our intelligence.

The spyware was used to target journalists, human rights activists, lawyers, and high-profile political figures, including French President Emmanuel Macron by Morocco. The investigation highlights cases such as the tracking of Dubai's Princess Latifa during her escape attempt and the targeting of Mexican journalist Cecilio Pineda weeks before his murder. The report establishes deep connections between NSO Group and Israeli intelligence, suggesting the Israeli government under BB Netanyahu leveraged the spyware as a key diplomatic tool to advance its foreign policy interests.",
