Support your local PBS station here: http://www.pbs.org/donate\u200b.\n\nIn 2020, the journalism nonprofit Forbidden Stories and Amnesty International gained access to a leaked list of more than 50,000 phone numbers. They suspected it contained numbers selected for potential surveillance with Pegasus. The Pegasus Project reporting consortium \u2014 which was led by Forbidden Stories and included 16 other media organizations, FRONTLINE among them \u2014 found that the spyware had been used on journalists, human rights activists, the wife and fianc\u00e9e of the murdered Saudi columnist Jamal Khashoggi, and others.\n\nOver two parts, this docuseries reveals the inside story of an investigation that prompted probes by governments and institutions around the world and sparked calls for an international treaty to govern the largely unregulated spyware industry.\n\nNSO, which has disputed some of the Pegasus Project\u2019s reporting, says that its technology was not associated in any way with Khashoggi\u2019s murder and that it sells Pegasus to vetted governments for \u201cthe sole purpose of preventing and investigating terror and serious crime.\u201d\n\nPart one of \u201cGlobal Spyware Scandal: Exposing Pegasus\u201d is available to stream here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZVj1_SE4Mo\n\nLearn more: https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/documentary/global-spyware-scandal-exposing-pegasus/\n\n#Documentary #Spyware #Surveillance\n\nFind FRONTLINE on the PBS App, where more than 300 of our documentaries are available to watch any time: https://to.pbs.org/FLVideoApp \nSubscribe on YouTube: http://bit.ly/1BycsJW \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/frontlinepbs \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/frontlinepbs \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/frontline \n\n\u201cGlobal Spyware Scandal: Exposing Pegasus\u201d is a FRONTLINE production with Forbidden Films.

    "full_text": "Pegasus. Pegasus. in collaboration with Forbidden films, a two-part investigation. This story would be huge. NSO was established with the ambition to make the world a safer place, into powerful spyware. It's a military weapon used against citizens, used around the world. There is no control over how countries use it and they have been using it in the worst way you could imagine. Now on Frontline, part two of Global Spyware scandal, exposing Pegasus. When you have your hands on a technology like this, the power must be quite intoxicating. You can get into the phone of most people in the world. and no one's looking over your shoulder. On va se faire un brief. La base de donn\u00e9es est vraiment explosive. Pegasus. Pegasus. Pegasus. Pegasus. It's like a person over your shoulder. A person who will see what you are seeing, a person who will watch what you are watching. your emails, your encrypted communication, everything. So once you are infected, you're trapped. It was against so many people in civil society who clearly were not terrorists or criminals. And you got a real sense that it was a free for all. De acuerdo con la pesquisa recabada por The Washington Post, The Guardian, Le Monde y otros medios. The joint investigation by 17 news outlets and Forbidden Story. Activists, lawyers, and journalists are reportedly among those who've been targeted by the phone spywar. phone numbers belonging to some big name politicians. NSO says they sell the software to governments for legitimate purposes, fighting terrorism or violating local laws. You have here a go-to spy service for tyrants. When we started analyzing the list, we saw a lot of French numbers. More than 1,000 potentially targeted by Morocco. There were journalists, lawyers, activists, but not only. We also saw members of the French government and the President Macron himself. We immediately realized that this story would be huge. Alors, je je vous explique juste peut-\u00eatre\u2026 Oui. OK. Donc \u00e7a c\u2019est \u00e7a c\u2019est le num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. \u00c7a c\u2019est dans la base de donn\u00e9es. Ouais. Oh ! Edouard Philippe. Edouard\u2026 Oh l\u00e0 l\u00e0 l\u00e0 l\u00e0. G\u00e9rald Darmanin. Ah, Le Drian. Ah ben aussi. Oh l\u00e0 l\u00e0, il y a vraiment tout le monde quoi. C\u2019est un truc de malade. La question \u00e7a va plus \u00eatre C'est qui qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9pargn\u00e9 ? Et ouais voil\u00e0, c\u2019est \u00e7a, c\u2019est qui est-ce qu'ils ont rat\u00e9 ? Allez, Julien de Normandie. We knew politicians were on the list and to prove that there had actually been infected with Pegasus, we needed their phones, but politicians wouldn\u2019t hand you their phone that easily, specifically if you\u2019re an investigative journalist. Oui, oui. Apr\u00e8s, je comprends tout \u00e0 fait si vous souhaitez pas le pas le faire, c\u2019est bien entendu votre droit le plus strict et Au revoir. Je pense qu\u2019il va dire non, lui. Il se trouve que parmi les personnes qui figurent dans la liste, il y a un ancien ministre qui n\u2019est plus au gouvernement et qui donc a une une forme de libert\u00e9 un peu plus grande que quelqu\u2019un qui serait encore actuellement au pouvoir, et c\u2019est Fran\u00e7ois de Rugy. Donc on a contact\u00e9 Fran\u00e7ois de Rugy en lui expliquant qu\u2019on souhaitait lui parler de quelque chose d\u2019extr\u00eamement confidentiel. Vous n\u2019\u00eates pas le seul ministre ou ex-ministre concern\u00e9. On en a au total quatorze. Et donc \u00e0 son cr\u00e9dit, il a il a fini par accepter, et donc on s'est\u2026 au total 14.\nEt donc \u00e0 son cr\u00e9dit, il a il a fini par accepter et donc on s'est revu pour proc\u00e9der \u00e0 \u00e0 l'analyse technique de de son t\u00e9l\u00e9phone et qui nous a permis de confirmer qu'effectivement il avait bien \u00e9t\u00e9 cibl\u00e9 et qu'il avait bien \u00e9t\u00e9 cibl\u00e9 par le client qu'on avait identifi\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant le royaume du Maroc.\nn'a pas eu l'air du tout surpris quand je lui ai annonc\u00e9 le pays.\nAh bon ? Il me dit qu'il a rencontr\u00e9 le roi.\nce qui est une bonne mani\u00e8re de te mettre sur les radars de ces gens.\nLe num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone qui est attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 Emmanuel Macron, la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape, \u00e7a a \u00e9t\u00e9 de v\u00e9rifier que le num\u00e9ro \u00e9tait encore actif aujourd'hui et que c'\u00e9tait bien toujours Emmanuel Macron qui l'utilisait.\nEt donc le moyen le plus simple de v\u00e9rifier s'il l'utilise toujours, c'est de lui \u00e9crire. Donc en fait, on va envoyer un SMS \u00e0 Emmanuel Macron.\nMonsieur le Pr\u00e9sident de la R\u00e9publique,\nOn publie aujourd'hui une enqu\u00eate internationale\nsur la cybersurveillance. Hmm hmm.\nDont vous-m\u00eame avez \u00e9t\u00e9 la cible ? Dont vous-m\u00eame avez \u00e9t\u00e9 la cible. C'est plus clair. Soyons clair. En plus, c'est pour \u00e7a. C'est \u00e7a que vous allez lui dire.\nAh bah oui, oui.\nDonc vous avez \u00e9t\u00e9 la cible.\nTu vois.\nOuais.\nC'est parti.\nEt donc Emmanuel Macron ne r\u00e9pond pas directement \u00e0 son SMS, mais une heure ou 2 heures apr\u00e8s avoir envoy\u00e9 ce SMS, les services de l'\u00c9lys\u00e9e nous rappellent\n\u00e0 propos du SMS qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9. Donc il l'a bien re\u00e7u. Le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone est toujours actif.\nOuais, ouais, bah l\u00e0 on va \u00e0 l'\u00c9lys\u00e9e l\u00e0.\nQuelques heures apr\u00e8s avoir envoy\u00e9 ce SMS \u00e0 Emmanuel Macron, on a re\u00e7u une invitation \u00e0 se rendre \u00e0 l'\u00c9lys\u00e9e, qui venait des services de l'\u00c9tat pour discuter ce que nous avions trouv\u00e9.\nPyramide.\nLe rendez-vous quand m\u00eame de ce matin, l'impression que \u00e7a nous a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 tous,\nc'\u00e9tait vraiment le c\u00f4t\u00e9 panique, enfin pas panique genre \"Oh mon Dieu, c'est horrible ce qui a pu se passer\", mais c'est plut\u00f4t \"Oh mon Dieu, toutes les implications potentielles de cette affaire sur tous les plans judiciaires, diplomatiques, s\u00e9curitaires, voil\u00e0 et que et que en fait ils verrouillent ils verrouillent la la communication.\nAssez rapidement, les experts de l'\u00c9tat vont confirmer qu'il y a bien eu des tentatives d'infection ou des infections dans certains cas sur les t\u00e9l\u00e9phones de certains ministres et sur les t\u00e9l\u00e9phones d'un certain nombre de tr\u00e8s hauts fonctionnaires fran\u00e7ais.\nLe r\u00e9sultat des analyses du t\u00e9l\u00e9phone du pr\u00e9sident de la R\u00e9publique est class\u00e9 secret d\u00e9fense et on y aura vraisemblablement jamais acc\u00e8s. euh fran\u00e7ais. Le r\u00e9sultat des analyses du t\u00e9l\u00e9phone du pr\u00e9sident de la R\u00e9publique est class\u00e9 secret d\u00e9fense et on n'y aura vraisemblablement jamais acc\u00e8s.\nWe don't know exactly who in Morocco was using Pegasus. There were Moroccan dissidents on the list, even the King of Morocco himself was on the list. But we do know that NSO only sells to governments and government agencies. We were reaching out to another dimension of the project. We were at this stage entering a space, a dangerous space where we were talking about a country, a state attacking another one.\nEach time you look at how a client of NSO Group used the technology, it tells you something about that government.\nIn the UAE, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum is Prime Minister, Vice President, and of course the ruler of Dubai. Here is an autocratic leader, massively powerful.\nPrincess Latifa is the daughter of Sheikh Mohammed. She had for a long time been by her account unhappy about her life in Dubai. She had been uh, incarcerated effectively by her father's regime.\nI'm making this video because it could be the last video I make.\nYeah.\nThis video can help me because all my father cares about is his reputation. He will kill people to protect his own reputation. He he he only cares about himself and his ego.\nPrincess Latifa concocted this extraordinary attempted escape that involved jet skis, a yacht, and a trip to the Indian Ocean.\nI mean, it's an audacious thing to do. Incredible even that she attempted it. I think remarkable that it nearly succeeded.\nThe day after Princess Latifa went missing from Dubai, we saw her number entered into the list. And in the days after that, as she was traveling toward India, went missing from Dubai. We saw her number entered into the list. And in the days after that, as she was traveling towards India on this yacht, her friends, people she knew, people within her orbit, their phone numbers also appeared on the list. If you look at the dates and times that her number and those of people close to her were entered into the system, you have something that has to be more than a coincidence. Eight days after her escape, Indian special forces boarded the yacht, and then the princess was forcibly returned to Dubai. We don't know exactly why the attempted escape didn't succeed, but NSO's technology was, it seems, from the evidence we've seen, you know, one of the tools that was being used by the state in a desperate attempt to find Princess Latifa, kidnap her and return her back to Dubai. We tried hard to get hold of a phone that Latifa had used, but we couldn't. So we contacted her friends and her associates to ask if we could check their phones to see if they had been targeted with Pegasus. Given how much David Haigh was working on the Latifa case, it wasn't a surprise when we discovered that there was Pegasus activity on his phone. I was infected on the 3rd of August 2020 with Pegasus. I believe about 3:00 a.m. in the morning and the next day as well. The fact that you can be hacked on British soil and that they can do that, it's frightening. It really is. My name is David Haigh from Detained International. Then we founded the campaign to free the Dubai Princess, Princess Latifa in 2018. David Haigh was actually imprisoned in Dubai for alleged fraud, and it was after his release that he became a human rights campaigner. Princess Latifa began to message him after her failed attempted escape. This is a picture that Latifa drew of the jail villa, Villa 96 in Jumeira, Dubai, near the Burj Al Arab. Um, and you can see here beach this direction where she was held captive. This villa has been converted into a jail. All the windows are barred shut. I can't open any window. Uh, there is five policemen outside and two police women inside the house. Uh I don't know what can happen to me and how long this will last and if they decide to release me, There's five policemen outside and two policewomen inside the house. I don't know what can happen to me and how long this will last and if they decide to release me, like how my life will be. But um, I'm not safe at all.\n\nThat week before I'd hacked, our secret contact with Latifa had stopped suddenly.\nThe several hours became a day and then two days.\nAnd then we started to worry because that was not normal.\nWe had recorded a lot of videos and a lot of evidence Latifa had that could be used to tell the world about her predicament, the fact that she's been held hostage.\nAt the time I was hacked, we were in London with the videos that Latifa recorded, the evidence to meet media to decide if we were going to use it at that time or not. It was effectively dynamite evidence on that phone.\nThe fact that they know your location, that someone could be listening to us now and seeing what we're doing. And it's that sitting in the back of your head every day.\nWe can't let NSO and the governments that abuse their system get away with what they've done. Because if we do, and if nothing happens and people are not brought to justice, people are not put in jail, and people are not taken to court, the next company and the next company and the next company, wherever they may be, will do exactly the same. And it will just carry on but get worse.\n\n\u05dc\u05d9\u05d1\u05d4 \u05e9\u05dc \u05d4\u05d7\u05d1\u05e8\u05d4 \u05d6\u05d4 \u05de\u05d4 \u05e9\u05d0\u05e0\u05d7\u05e0\u05d5 \u05e7\u05d5\u05e8\u05d0\u05d9\u05dd \u05dc\u05d5 \u05d7\u05d5\u05e7\u05e8\u05d9 \u05d7\u05d5\u05dc\u05e9\u05d5\u05ea. \u05d0\u05ea\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d5\u05e7\u05d7 \u05de\u05e2\u05e8\u05db\u05ea \u05db\u05de\u05d5 \u05d4\u05d0\u05d9\u05d9\u05e4\u05d5\u05df, \u05e9\u05e2\u05d1\u05d3\u05d5 \u05e2\u05dc \u05d6\u05d4 \u05d4\u05de\u05d4\u05e0\u05d3\u05e1\u05d9\u05dd \u05d4\u05d8\u05d5\u05d1\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd, \u05d5\u05d0\u05ea\u05d4 \u05de\u05d5\u05e6\u05d0 \u05d3\u05e8\u05da \u05dc\u05d4\u05ea\u05d2\u05d1\u05e8 \u05e2\u05dc \u05d6\u05d4. \u05d0\u05d1\u05dc \u05d9\u05e9 \u05de\u05e0\u05d2\u05e0\u05d5\u05df \u05d3\u05d9 \u05de\u05e9\u05d5\u05de\u05df \u05e9\u05dc \u05d2\u05d9\u05d5\u05e1 \u05d9\u05d5\u05e6\u05d0\u05d9 \u05d9\u05d7\u05d9\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05de\u05d7\u05e9\u05d1\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05e6\u05d1\u05d0, \u05dc\u05d4\u05d9\u05d9\u05d8\u05e7 \u05d4\u05d0\u05d6\u05e8\u05d7\u05d9, \u05dc\u05db\u05dc \u05de\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9, \u05dc\u05db\u05dc \u05de\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d7\u05d1\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea. 8200 \u05d4\u05d9\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d7\u05d9\u05d3\u05d4 \u05d2\u05d3\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4 \u05d1\u05ea\u05d5\u05da \u05d4\u05e6\u05d1\u05d0. \u05e6\u05d1\u05d0 \u05dc\u05d4\u05d9\u05d9\u05d8\u05e7 \u05d4\u05d0\u05d6\u05e8\u05d7\u05d9, \u05dc\u05db\u05dc \u05de\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9, \u05dc\u05db\u05dc \u05de\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d7\u05d1\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea.\n8200 \u05d4\u05d9\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d7\u05d9\u05d3\u05d4 \u05d2\u05d3\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4 \u05d1\u05ea\u05d5\u05da \u05d4\u05e6\u05d1\u05d0.\n\u05d5\u05d1\u05ea\u05d5\u05da \u05d4\u05d9\u05d7\u05d9\u05d3\u05d4 \u05d4\u05d6\u05d0\u05ea\u05d9, \u05e2\u05d5\u05e1\u05e7\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05e1\u05d9\u05d9\u05d1\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d4\u05ea\u05e7\u05e4\u05d9 \u05e9\u05dc \u05e6\u05d1\u05d0 \u05d4\u05d2\u05e0\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc, \u05e9\u05dc \u05e6\u05d4\"\u05dc.\n\u05db\u05e9\u05e6\u05e8\u05d9\u05db\u05d9\u05dd \u05dc\u05d4\u05d5\u05e6\u05d9\u05d0 \u05de\u05d9\u05d3\u05e2 \u05de\u05d4\u05d0\u05d5\u05d9\u05d1\u05d9\u05dd \u05e9\u05dc\u05e0\u05d5, \u05d6\u05d4 \u05d4\u05d0\u05e0\u05e9\u05d9\u05dd \u05e9\u05d9\u05e2\u05e9\u05d5 \u05d0\u05ea \u05d6\u05d4.\n\u05d9\u05e9 \u05dc\u05d4\u05dd \u05d9\u05d3\u05e2 \u05e9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d0 \u05e0\u05d3\u05d9\u05e8.\n\u05dc\u05d5\u05e7\u05d7\u05d9\u05dd \u05d9\u05dc\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05e0\u05d9 18,\n\u05de\u05db\u05e9\u05d9\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05d0\u05d5\u05ea\u05dd \u05de\u05d0\u05d5\u05d3 \u05de\u05d4\u05e8 \u05d5\u05de\u05d0\u05d5\u05d3 \u05dc\u05e2\u05d5\u05de\u05e7.\nIsrael has this advantage of not only developing new technologies and weaponry, but testing it live.\nAnd this is something Israel knows it can use to sell outside.\nWhen you want to control a huge population, like we do with Palestinians, you have to have assets everywhere.\nSo, everyone can be a target because you don't want only the, I don't know,\nterrorist from Hamas, but also maybe his neighbor or the his cousin or the person who sells milk in the corner of the street.\nIf you want to recruit human agents, you need to collect their weaknesses, things that you can use to blackmail.\nAnd so, part of what 8200 does is to collect this\nblackmail potential information about everybody.\nIf you're gay or if you have medical, special medical condition or you have uh\nfinancial problems or someone from your family has one of those,\nthen that's something we can use against you to blackmail you and get you to cooperate.\nIsraeli intelligence has a strategic view of how their employees should be used after they leave their employ.\nThey promote them, they want them to start these companies,\nand they see a deep communications, a continued relationship between the government and their former employees as valuable to Israel's national security interest.\nThere's a lot of evidence to suggest that NSO Group had the the direct backing and support of Bibi Netanyahu's government.\nIn order to sell its product to governments around the world, it required permits, effectively licenses from the Israeli Defense Ministry. in order to sell its product to governments around the world, it required permits, effectively licenses from the Israeli Defense ministry. I decided several years ago to turn Israel into one of the five uh cyber powers of the world. In order for the companies to develop, they need to make, what do they need to make? Money. They need to make money. Now, the easiest way to make sure that they don't make money is one, high taxes, right? What's the other one? Regulations. Have you ever heard of regulations? We have a problem with regulations. So the policy we have is keep taxes low and keep regulations low. Minimize regulations. There is no industry more susceptible and more inviting of regulations than cyber security. It's like weapons.

Going through all the numbers on the list was a huge job. More than 15,000 of the numbers were in Mexico. And one of those numbers belonged to a journalist who was murdered just weeks after he was put on the list. Was Pegasus used in that case to spy on a journalist or to geolocate him? \u00bfSabes que Cecilio Pineda es tambi\u00e9n en la lista? \u00bfS\u00ed? \u00bfEl que fue asesinado? S\u00ed. En la lista, s\u00ed. Qu\u00e9 fuerte. En M\u00e9xico es muy grave que se haya usado Pegasus como se us\u00f3. Me remito al caso de Cecilio Pineda. y de Pegasus Project lo mostr\u00f3 p\u00fablicamente que su tel\u00e9fono fue ingresado d\u00edas antes o semanas antes de haber sido cometido el asesinato. El estado de Guerrero es una de las entidades m\u00e1s impactadas por el crimen organizado. Hay lugares en donde literalmente el Estado ya no tiene dominio. Las autoridades en realidad est\u00e1n pues mezcladas con el crimen organizado. Y hay pues actividad del del narcotr\u00e1fico, hay actividad diversa eh delincuencial. De acuerdo con el reporte de la polic\u00eda, varios sujetos armados llegaron a un autolavado donde el periodista Cecilio Pineda esperaba que le entregaran su camioneta y le dispararon. No me sorprende que Cecilio Pineda estuviera en esa lista porque el tema que se estaba tocando era serio. Pues la neta nos estamos cansados de violencia, pero nadie tiene segura su vida. Tambi\u00e9n es verdad vivimos una regi\u00f3n donde estamos solos, en una regi\u00f3n en donde todas las autoridades pues no te no te apoyan, y aqu\u00ed uno tiene que defenderse con sus propias u\u00f1as. Buenas tardes, amigos de Tierra Caliente. Pues aqu\u00ed ya de regreso despu\u00e9s de estar en dos municipios de la regi\u00f3n y pues nos encontramos con esto. A Cecilio le debe el Chun video. Ven\u00eda en camino y quiso dar un mensaje anticipado de lo que iba a presentar despu\u00e9s. \u00c9l dijo que unas horas despu\u00e9s iba a mostrar el video de la relaci\u00f3n que hab\u00eda entre el gobierno del Estado y el grupo del Tequilero. Despu\u00e9s de eso ya no present\u00f3 nada. Ah\u00ed lo asesinaron. Ese d\u00eda, este, Y ya al llegar a la cl\u00ednica este yo quise pasar a verlo. Entonces me dice la se\u00f1orita, no, s\u00ed lo est\u00e1n atendiendo. Entonces yo pens\u00e9 pues que iba a estar bien. Dije, \"No, pues nada m\u00e1s fue pues algo.\" Ya como a los, a los tres minutos, sale. sepas que ibas a estar bien. Dije, no, pues nada m\u00e1s fue pues algo. Ya como a los, a los tres minutos sale el doctor. Dice, no dice, pues ya. Ya falleci\u00f3. Y es la \u00fanica vez en mi vida que que me he desmayado. Y cuando volv\u00ed, pues estaba toda aturdida, dije, pues no sab\u00eda qu\u00e9 y pues ya fue cuando me volvieron a decir, pues que ya hab\u00eda fallecido. que este que que ya hab\u00eda llegado pr\u00e1cticamente casi muerto, pues. You can only prove infection if you do forensics on the phone and find traces of Pegasus. But in many cases, the phone was not findable. That was the case of Cecilio Pineda. No se puede afirmar categ\u00f3ricamente que lo que se obtuvo de el posible espionaje haya sido lo que provoc\u00f3 el asesinato. Pero tampoco podemos ser ingenuos. We were able to set up a date where we all agreed that will be the day of the publication. in 2021, July 18th. We knew that the most dangerous phase was those two weeks before the publication, when you knock on the door of the NSO group to say, \"Hey, we are forbidden stories, we are 80 reporters, we investigate your businesses and we have evidence of a global misuse that is threatening democracy. On rentre dans la phase un peu d'inconnu, peut-\u00eatre que en face, il va y avoir une vraie strat\u00e9gie pour discr\u00e9diter tout ce qu'on a fait. They can blackmail the source. They can hack me, one of the person of the team. They can follow us. They can come into our offices. By now, the members of the consortium had managed to do forensics on over 60 phones connected to numbers on the list, and we had forensic proof that at least 37 phones members of the consortium had managed to do forensics on over 60 phones connected to numbers on the list. And we had forensic proof that at least 37 phones had been targeted or infected with Pegasus. The more publication day was approaching, the more paranoid we all became. Before publication, we already had that habit to switching off the phones or even our computers before having any conversation about the investigation. So most of the day, we were living and working without our phones or even our computers. So we had different ways of working, we had other devices we could work on. Et il faut s'attendre \u00e0 \u00e7a. Il faut s'attendre \u00e0 ce que m\u00eame nos partenaires aient des r\u00e9serves parce que NSO les aura approch\u00e9s ou des des proches de NSO les auront approch\u00e9s pour leur dire que en fait on s'est tromp\u00e9. I remember that day clicking on the button send. I was sending the official request for comment from the 80 reporters with dozens of question inside. We were giving a deadline to the NSO group and to all the state actors. And we were expecting some answers. Hello. This is Laurent Richard from Forbidden Stories. How are you doing? Yeah, I'm good. I'm good. Yeah, thank thank you for taking the time to to answer. Uh Uh, I was just wondering if you um are planning to answer our question. Yeah, you you can see it in your email now. Yeah. Okay, I see it. Thank you. Okay. Bye. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Okay. What we got is an email from the NSO Group saying that all you think is wrong. Thank you, best regards. NSO group firmly denies false claims made in your report, which many of them are uncorroborated theories that raise serious doubts about the real liability of your sources, as well as the basis of your story. Euh, c'est incroyable. C'est dingue. But then when I woke up in the next morning, I opened my phone, and I saw that NSO had sent letters from lawyers to most of the partners on all continents to threaten them and to tell them that if you publish anything, we will sue you. send letters from lawyers to most of the partners on all continents to threaten them and to tell them that if you publish anything, we will sue you. It's a bit tense here if I'm honest. Yeah. Yeah. Um we've had a provisional response from NSO to the Washington Post. Um and we will have the formal another response from them to us in about 15, 20 minutes. So we're going to keep this call really quick. Um The stakes are really high when you do this kind of reporting. Here was a company valued at over a billion dollars. And the NSO group and its clients, these governments, were not going to put their hands up and confess to this activity. They were fighting it as hard as they possibly could. All going well, if we're proceeding with this project, I think the crunch point really is going to be in the next 12 hours. What do you mean in the sense of if we are proceeding, Paul? Yeah. Is that in doubt? Well, it's all it's it's it's never it's never confirmed until it's confirmed, right? We can confirm at least three names from your investigation, Emmanuel Macron, King Mohammed VI and Tedros Ghebreyesus, are not and have never been targets or selected as targets by NSO Group customers. En mars 2019, alors que le pr\u00e9sident Macron suit de tr\u00e8s pr\u00e8s la crise politique qui secoue l'Alg\u00e9rie, c'est \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 que l'un de ses num\u00e9ros est enregistr\u00e9 par un service marocain. So Paul, just to be 100% clear, you guys are ready to hit the button on a version of the story in 42 minutes. Of the heads of state story. Heads of state only. We're not ready now, but in 42 minutes we will be ready. story in 42 minutes. Of the heads of state story. Heads of state only. We're not ready now, but in 42 minutes, we will be ready. So here we were, simultaneously publishing 17 different media outlets all over the world in several different languages, all at the same time, on the same minute, on the same day, after months of investigating. An investigation into the NSO. Let me check with everyone. A investigation into the NSO group. 10 10 That's okay. And just say, yeah, and it's Clarence, let's just go with that. Quatre, trois, deux, un, z\u00e9ro, c'est parti. Allez. Putain. 18. On est bon, 18. on a un coup de web. 18 So the story is now live. An explosive investigation from the Washington Post and a consortium of media partners. Activists, lawyers and journalists are reportedly among those Una investigaci\u00f3n de diversos medios revel\u00f3 una lista de celulares de la utilizaci\u00f3n de Pegasus en el mundo. L'\u00c9lys\u00e9e prend cette affaire avec beaucoup de s\u00e9rieux. Il faut pas que les choses retombent dans quelques jours. Pegasus est utilis\u00e9 par des \u00e9tats pour cibler des journalistes, des politiques et m\u00eame des chefs d'\u00c9tat. What can be done to protect our country from commercial spyware? The kind of threat that is now being reported at the top of the news across the nation. There had been reporters who had been doing stories on Pegasus for years. This sort of tipped the scale because it was in so many countries, it was against so many people in civil society who clearly were not terrorists or criminals. And you got a real sense that it was an, it was a free for all. We even found out afterwards that the FBI considered using a version of Pegasus that could hack into US phones. But that fell apart and the Biden administration actually blacklisted NSO Group. They've made a bigger deal than I would have expected against not just an Israeli company, but really they're criticizing the Israeli government for allowing this to happen because it actually could not happen without the Israeli government's permission. You have here a go-to spy service for tyrants. What the executives of these companies and the engineers are hoping for most is to make a whole lot of money. what the executives of these companies and the engineers are hoping for most is to make a whole lot of money and do it in a way where there's minimal regulation and minimal oversight. A US appeals court is allowing WhatsApp messaging service to move forward with a lawsuit against NSO Group over allegedly targeting Silicon Valley has a big role to play. company like WhatsApp, company like Apple. They are suing NSO. They are the ones with money, they are the ones who promise you safety and security. All we've seen NSO Group is deny, deny, deny, and that's shown up entirely through the legal process as well. The way I think about it is tech companies can and should do everything they can to make their software as secure as possible. But at the end of the day, if there's no consequences for people who try to break that software to commit human rights abuses, then there will always be people trying to do it. It's just like the only solution to stopping um bank robbery is not to have the best technology in banks. Yes, you do that too. It's also that bank robbers get caught and have consequences for trying to to rob banks, and we need that for the Spyware industry. Pegasus Spyware is once again back in the spotlight. This time for targeting pro-independence supporters in Spain's Catalonia. Several members of Poland's opposition have produced evidence they were hacked by Pegasus. This scandal is being dubbed the Polish Watergate. In Europe, we were discovering new victims of the Spyware, and new countries were accused of using Pegasus to spy on their opponents. At the European Parliament, representatives from NSO agreed to answer questions from politicians. It was the first time they'd done this. Ich bin Hannah Neumann, Mitglied des Europ\u00e4ischen Parlaments. Ich bin stellvertretende Vorsitzende des Menschenrechtsausschusses. Es war schon ein langer Weg zu diesem Untersuchungsausschuss zu kommen. Die zentrale Herausforderung wird sein, wie stark kooperieren diese Akteure mit uns. We know that NSO is now on the market. So maybe they are trying to polish their image. That would be interesting to see. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. On behalf of NSO, I want to thank the members of the committee of inquiry for having us here today. Before we begin, we should note that there are limits to the information we can share with the committee and others. As you know, NSO is a private company providing export-controlled cyber intelligence technologies only and exclusive to government agencies for the purpose of preventing and investigating terrorism and other serious crimes. As a result, we are unable to share details about our customers, as well as the crimes prevented and criminals tracked and apprehended using our technologies or trade secrets of the technology. It is not true that NSO Group operates Pegasus and collects information about individuals. It is not true that NSO Group sells its technology to private companies. The issues that came up about Jamal Khashoggi, about President Macron Macron, the system was not used on those numbers. I will go immediately into the Q&A session of today's meeting. We already have about 15 members who've asked for the floor. Have you ever terminated a contract with an EU member state? We have terminated contracts with the EU member states, but to get into again, exact numbers... That's fine. Thank you. Next question. If a country does not give you a permission to audit, is that a reason for you to terminate a contract? Yes or no? As I stated before, if they do not allow us to do the audit and do not participate in the provide us with the information needed in our investigation, yes, that is a reason to terminate a contract. I can state with you that we've terminated eight customers over the past several years. Have United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia ever gone through your due diligence check and have they passed it? As I said, I'm not going to respond to questions regarding specific uh potential customers. Given that UAE and Saudi Arabia have been using Pegasus software, who are legitimate actors to issue warrants in these countries according to your checks? Again, I repeat it again. I'm not going to respond to questions regarding specific customers. Yes, I hear. Witam pana. Witam pana. Jestem z Polski. Czy o szpiegowaniu szefa kampanii wyborczej w Polsce dowiedzieli\u015bcie si\u0119 w roku 2019, kiedy to mia\u0142o miejsce, wed\u0142ug doniesie\u0144 medialnych?

I cannot, and again I repeat, I cannot because of various confidentiality and secrecy issues, I cannot get into specific questions regarding specific customers or specific cases. Ezzel kapcsolatban lenn\u00e9nek azok a k\u00e9rd\u00e9seim, hogy van-e m\u00e9g tov\u00e1bbra is \u00e9l\u0151 szerz\u0151d\u00e9s\u00fck a magyar korm\u00e1nnyal, amennyiben nincs \u00e9l\u0151 szerz\u0151d\u00e9s\u00fck, akkor azt mikor \u00e9s milyen okb\u00f3l bontott\u00e1k fel, illetve van arra lehet\u0151s\u00e9g, hogy a magyar korm\u00e1ny \u00fajra szerz\u0151dj\u00f6n az NSO NSO csoporttal, \u00fajra megk\u00f6sse ezt a szerz\u0151d\u00e9st. First of all, every customer that we sell to goes through the due diligence review in advance, and if and very often if concerns are raised regarding the rule of law because what we're looking at is also rule of law and any country that we've decided to sell to has been approved in our. please stop the stop the storytelling. I'm going to continue in Hungarian. Direkten mondom Magyarorsz\u00e1g p\u00e9ld\u00e1j\u00e1t, teh\u00e1t hogy folyamatosan el\u00edt\u00e9lnek egy tag\u00e1llamot k\u00fcl\u00f6nb\u00f6z\u0151 jog\u00e1llamis\u00e1gi krit\u00e9riumok alapj\u00e1n, akkor \u00f6n\u00f6k sz\u00e1m\u00e1ra az mi\u00e9rt jelent biztons\u00e1gos orsz\u00e1got?

I I have not said, we have not said that we have determined recently that Hungary is or is not a secure country. You did consider it secure because you sold this stuff to them. Excuse me, excuse me colleagues. Excuse me, can you please. I said now we... Let's let's keep a little bit of order in the meeting as well. I understand there is frustration, but you have the concrete question, we have a concrete answer, and please. So you keep repeating the same thing, and there seems to be complete disconnect between reality and between what you're saying. This is like, you know, it's an insult to our intelligence, sorry. \u05db\u05e8\u05d2\u05e2 \u05d9\u05e9 \u05e2\u05d6\u05d9\u05d1\u05d4 \u05e9\u05dc \u05d1\u05db\u05d9\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1-NSO

    "summary": "An extensive international investigation by a consortium of 17 news organizations, led by Forbidden Stories, uncovered the widespread abuse of Pegasus, a powerful spyware developed by the Israeli company NSO Group. Originally marketed for fighting terrorism, the investigation revealed it was systematically used by government clients to target journalists, human rights activists, lawyers, and high-profile political figures globally. Key findings include the targeting of French President Emmanuel Macron by Morocco, the use of the spyware by the UAE to track the escaping Princess Latifa, and the murder of a Mexican journalist, Cecilio Pineda, weeks after his number appeared on a target list. The report also highlights the Israeli government's role in promoting NSO as a tool of diplomatic leverage. Despite forensic evidence confirming infections on numerous devices, NSO Group has denied the claims.",
