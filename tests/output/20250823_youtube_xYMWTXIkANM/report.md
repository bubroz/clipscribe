## Executive Summary

An extensive international investigation by a consortium of 17 news organizations, led by Forbidden Stories, uncovered the widespread abuse of Pegasus, a powerful spyware developed by the Israeli company NSO Group. Originally marketed for fighting terrorism, the investigation revealed it was systematically used by government clients to target journalists, human rights activists, lawyers, and high-profile political figures globally. Key findings include the targeting of French President Emmanuel Macron by Morocco, the use of the spyware by the UAE to track the escaping Princess Latifa, and the murder of a Mexican journalist, Cecilio Pineda, weeks after his number appeared on a target list. The report also highlights the Israeli government's role in promoting NSO as a tool of diplomatic leverage. Despite forensic evidence confirming infections on numerous devices, NSO Group has denied the claims.
