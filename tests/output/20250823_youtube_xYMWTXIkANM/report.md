## Executive Summary

An international journalistic investigation, 'The Pegasus Project', reveals that Pegasus, a military-grade spyware developed by the Israeli firm NSO Group, has been sold to and misused by authoritarian and democratic governments worldwide. The spyware was used to target journalists, human rights activists, lawyers, and high-profile political figures, including French President Emmanuel Macron by Morocco. The investigation highlights cases such as the tracking of Dubai's Princess Latifa during her escape attempt and the targeting of Mexican journalist Cecilio Pineda weeks before his murder. The report establishes deep connections between NSO Group and Israeli intelligence, suggesting the Israeli government under BB Netanyahu leveraged the spyware as a key diplomatic tool to advance its foreign policy interests.
