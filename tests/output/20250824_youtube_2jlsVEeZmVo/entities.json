    "The death of Gerard and Mikey Way's grandmother during the album's development caused a major lyrical shift from a fictional concept story to a more personal exploration of grief and loss.",
    "My Chemical Romance's fusion of post-hardcore, pop-punk, and emo aesthetics allowed them to unify and anchor the scattered 'mall goth' scene of the early 2000s.",
    "The band's 'Revenge era' look, characterized by long hair, makeup, and a red-and-black color scheme, became their most enduring and recognizable image."
