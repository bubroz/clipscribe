  "key_facts": [
    "The Pegasus spyware, developed by NSO Group, is a military-grade weapon capable of infecting mobile phones and gaining complete access to all data, including encrypted messages, calls, microphone, and camera, effectively turning a phone into a 24/7 surveillance device.",
    "A massive leak of over 50,000 phone numbers selected as potential targets for surveillance by NSO Group clients between 2016 and 2020 sparked a global investigation known as the Pegasus Project.",
    "Forensic analysis confirmed that phones belonging to Jamal Khashoggi's fianc\u00e9e, Hatice Cengiz, and his wife, Hanan Atar, were infected with Pegasus spyware, contradicting NSO Group's denials of involvement in the Khashoggi affair.",
    "The Pegasus Project was a collaborative effort involving over 80 journalists from 17 media organizations, including The Washington Post and The Guardian, coordinated by Forbidden Stories.",
    "Mexico was a significant client of NSO Group, with over 15,000 numbers in the leaked data, targeting a wide range of individuals including prominent journalist Carmen Aristegui, politicians, activists, and their families."
