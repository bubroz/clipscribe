## Executive Summary

This intelligence report details a global investigation, the Pegasus Project, into the powerful spyware 'Pegasus' developed by the Israeli firm NSO Group. Based on a leak of 50,000 phone numbers of potential targets, a consortium of 17 news organizations uncovered widespread, systematic abuse of the spyware against journalists, human rights activists, and political dissidents worldwide. Key findings include forensic evidence proving Pegasus was used to target individuals close to murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi, contradicting NSO's denials. The investigation also revealed extensive use in countries like Mexico, where over 15,000 numbers were targeted, including prominent journalists investigating government corruption. The report outlines the spyware's capabilities, which allow for complete control over an infected device, and highlights the significant threat it poses to democracy and individual liberty.
