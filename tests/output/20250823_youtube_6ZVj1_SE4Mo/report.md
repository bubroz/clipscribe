## Executive Summary

An international consortium of news outlets, led by Forbidden Stories, investigated a massive data leak of 50,000 phone numbers targeted by clients of the Israeli NSO Group's Pegasus spyware between 2016 and 2020. The investigation reveals that this military-grade surveillance tool, which can completely compromise a smartphone, was used globally against journalists, human rights activists, and political dissidents. Key findings include the confirmed targeting of individuals close to murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi, directly contradicting NSO's denials, and the widespread surveillance of Mexican journalist Carmen Aristegui and her extensive network. The project relied on forensic analysis from Amnesty International and Citizen Lab to verify the spyware's presence on victims' devices, exposing a global scandal of invasive digital surveillance.
