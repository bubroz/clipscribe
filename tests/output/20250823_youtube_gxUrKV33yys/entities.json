    "The formation of My Chemical Romance was directly catalyzed by Gerard Way witnessing the September 11th attacks, which inspired him to pursue music and write the band's first song, 'Skylines and Turnstyles'.",
    "The band's core members are Gerard Way, his brother Mikey Way, guitarist Ray Toro, and guitarist Frank Iero, with a rotating cast of drummers.",
    "Frank Iero's previous band, Pency Prep, and his connections within the New Jersey DIY punk scene, particularly with Eyeball Records and the band Thursday, were crucial for MCR's early success.",
    "The members' upbringing in a crime-ridden New Jersey during the '80s and '90s fostered an isolated, nerdy disposition focused on comics, fantasy, and music, which heavily influenced their artistic style.",
    "Ray Toro, a highly skilled guitarist, had initially given up on a music career to pursue filmmaking before being convinced by Gerard Way to join the band."
