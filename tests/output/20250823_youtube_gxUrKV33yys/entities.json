    "The September 11, 2001 attacks were the direct catalyst for Gerard Way forming My Chemical Romance, after he witnessed the event firsthand.",
    "The band's core and most influential lineup consisted of Gerard Way, Mikey Way, Ray Toro, and Frank Iero.",
    "Frank Iero's prior band, Pencey Prep, and his connections to Eyeball Records were critical for MCR securing a record deal and practice space.",
    "The members' upbringing in a violent New Jersey environment during the '80s and '90s led them to introverted, creative pursuits like music and comics.",
    "The band's debut album, 'I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love,' recorded in early 2002, is considered their most raw and heavy work."
