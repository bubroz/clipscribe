## Executive Summary

This intelligence package details the formation and early history of the band My Chemical Romance. The band's creation was a direct result of frontman Gerard Way's traumatic experience witnessing the 9/11 attacks, which motivated him to leave his career in comics and pursue music. The core lineup solidified with his brother Mikey Way on bass, highly-skilled guitarist Ray Toro, and guitarist Frank Iero, whose connections from his previous band, Pency Prep, were instrumental. Raised in the often violent environment of New Jersey, the members developed an isolated, creative focus that shaped their unique sound. Their raw 'attic demos' led to their signing with Eyeball Records and the creation of their 2002 debut album, 'I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love', produced by Geoff Rickly of Thursday.
