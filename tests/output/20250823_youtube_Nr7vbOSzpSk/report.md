## Executive Summary

A former Tier One operator and selection instructor provides an overview of the differences between US Special Operations Tier One and Tier Two units. The brief outlines the specific units in each tier (e.g., Delta Force in Tier 1, Rangers in Tier 2), clarifies common colloquialisms like 'White SOF' vs. 'Black SOF' and task force color designators, and highlights the fundamental distinction in their selection processes: Tier Two selections are team-based and employ high-stress negative reinforcement, whereas Tier One selections are almost exclusively individual events with a complete absence of feedback.
