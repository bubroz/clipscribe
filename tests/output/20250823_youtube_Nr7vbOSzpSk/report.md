## Executive Summary

A former Tier 1 operator and selection instructor provides the first of a three-part series on passing Special Operations selections. This segment defines and differentiates between Tier 1 (e.g., Delta Force, DEVGRU) and Tier 2 (e.g., Rangers, Special Forces) units, referred to as 'Black SOF' and 'White SOF' respectively. The primary distinction discussed is their selection process: Tier 2 selections are psychologically aggressive with team events, while Tier 1 selections are strictly individual with neutral feedback. The speaker also details unit-specific colloquialisms, including the color-based identifiers used for Tier 1 task forces.
