    "Tier 2 selections are characterized by yelling, negative reinforcement, and team-oriented events, whereas Tier 1 selections feature no positive or negative reinforcement and are almost entirely individual events.",
    "The three main operational Tier 1 units are Delta Force, DEVGRU (SEAL Team 6), and the Intelligence Support Activity.",
    "Tier 2 units, also known as 'White SOF', include Rangers, Special Forces, MARSOC Raiders, Marine Force Recon, and most Navy SEAL teams (excluding SEAL Team 6).",
    "Tier 1 units used task force color identifiers: Green for Delta Force, Blue for SEAL Team 6, and Orange for the Intelligence Support Activity (TFO).",
    "SEAL Team 6 is considered a 'Black SOF' or 'varsity' unit, distinct and much larger than other 'White SOF' or 'JV' SEAL teams."
