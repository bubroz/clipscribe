    "The primary difference between Tier 1 and Tier 2 selection processes is that Tier 2 focuses on team events with negative reinforcement (yelling), while Tier 1 uses individual events with neutral reinforcement (no feedback).",
    "The three main operational Tier 1 units are identified as Delta Force, DEVGRU (SEAL Team Six), and the Intelligence Support Activity (ISA).",
    "The speaker is a former Tier 1 operator who also served as an instructor for a Tier 1 selection, providing an insider's perspective on how these processes work.",
    "Tier 1 units utilize color-based codenames for identification: Delta Force is Green, SEAL Team Six is Blue, and the ISA is Orange.",
    "Tier 2 units, referred to as 'white SOF', include Rangers, Special Forces, MARSOC Raiders, Marine Force Recon, and most Navy SEAL teams."
