## Executive Summary

A former Tier 1 operator and selection instructor provides an overview of the differences between US Special Operations Tier 1 and Tier 2 units. The analysis covers the specific units in each tier (e.g., Tier 1: Delta Force, SEAL Team Six; Tier 2: Rangers, Special Forces), common terminology such as 'White SOF' vs. 'Black SOF', and task force color-based identifiers. A key distinction highlighted is the selection process: Tier 2 selections are high-stress, team-based environments, while Tier 1 selections are almost entirely individual-based with a neutral feedback approach.
