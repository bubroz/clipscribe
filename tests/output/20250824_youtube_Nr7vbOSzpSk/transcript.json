    "description": "\ud83d\udccc Part 1 of 3: The Difference Between Tier 1 and Tier 2 Units \u2013 How to Pass Special Operations Selections\n\nWelcome to Part 1 of my three-part series on how to pass Tier 1 and Tier 2 selections in U.S. Special Operations.\n\nBefore you can even think about surviving selection, you need to understand what you're preparing for. Too many people say they want to go \u201cTier 1\u201d without knowing what that even means. This video is all about laying out the real differences between Tier 1 and Tier 2 units, so you know exactly what you\u2019re getting into\u2014and why it matters.\n\n\ud83d\udd0e What\u2019s the difference?\nTier 2 units are elite, but they\u2019re designed for broader special operations missions. These include:\n\u2705 Army Special Forces (Green Berets)\n\u2705 75th Ranger Regiment\n\u2705 Navy SEAL Teams\n\u2705 Marine Raiders (MARSOC)\n\u2705 Air Force Special Tactics\n\nThese units train hard, deploy constantly, and often work in small teams advising partners, conducting raids, or preparing the battlespace for larger missions.\n\nTier 1 units, on the other hand, are the nation\u2019s most secretive, specialized, and capable counterterror and hostage rescue forces:\n\u2705 Delta Force (CAG)\n\u2705 SEAL Team 6 (DEVGRU)\n\u2705 Intelligence Support Activity \n\nTheir selection is even more grueling, and their training pipelines are longer, with a focus on direct action, surgical strikes, and high-value target capture or kill missions. These units are given priority funding, access to cutting-edge technology, and often work with the highest-level intelligence to conduct missions that other units simply can\u2019t.\n\n\u26a1 Why is this important?\nBecause your preparation must match your target. Tier 2 selections test your ability to operate in small teams, endure physically demanding tasks, and show leadership under stress. Tier 1 selections go further\u2014they strip away the team support and evaluate you as an individual problem-solver under relentless pressure.\n\nIf you don't understand these differences, you'll train for the wrong fight.\n\n\ud83d\udc4a Coming Up Next:\nPart 2 \u2013 How to Pass Tier 2 Selections\nPart 3 \u2013 How to Pass Tier 1 Selections\n\nIf you have questions, thoughts, or your own experiences, drop them in the comments\u2014I read everything. And make sure you subscribe so you don\u2019t miss the next parts of this series.\n\nThanks for watching\u2014and train smart.\n\n#Tier1 #Tier2 #SpecialForces #SOF #MilitarySelection #HowToPassSelection #GreenBerets #NavySEALs #DeltaForce #DEVGRU #Ranger #MARSOC #USMilitary #SpecOps #MilitaryAdvice #VeteranTips #MilitaryTraining #SpecialOperations"

    "full_text": "This is part one of a three-part series of how to pass tier one and tier two selections. Part one will be covering the differences between tier one and tier two units and also with a focus on how they do selections differently.\n\nFirst to cover my background, I'm former Special Forces, a tier one operator, and after I passed selection, about four years after I passed selection, I had the honor and the privilege to actually be a cadre/instructor for a tier one selection. So I got to see, not only, I was behind the scenes and I got to see actually how these selections work um, from the back side. So, so first, how what's the difference between tier one and two? So first of all, let's cover some colloquialisms. You're going to hear white SOF versus black SOF. Your white SOF is your tier two guys, which is your Rangers, your Special Forces, your MARSOC Raiders, your uh Marine Force Recon, and your SEALs. Quick caveat with SEALs. There's two types of SEALs, there's two levels of SEALs. You have your JV SEALs, your varsity SEALs, your white side SEALs, your black side SEALs. Most SEALs that you meet, whether it's any SEAL team other than SEAL Team Six are your white side SEALs, your vanilla SEALs. We also commonly refer to them as the JV SEALs. Your SEAL Team Six is an entire another organization about five times if not larger than any other actual SEAL team because they have three to four times as many operators and they have like five to 10 times more support staff. So.\n\nSo that's the difference, all right? And your tier one units, all right? Your three main operational tier one units, which are designed after uh organizational structures designed after the British SAS. They have squadrons and they have troops, is your Delta Force, your um DevGru or SEAL Team Six and not as well commonly known unit is known as the Intelligence Support Activity.\n\nAnd there are a couple adjacent units, uh like the 24th STS, which are is your Air Force Special Operations. They have your JTACs, they have your TACPs, your Forward Air Controls, your Pararescue. So these guys are they support not only tier two but also tier one elements. I've been served along JTACs in both tier two and tier one. And actually, I love the AFSOC guys, they're amazing, but I'm not quite completely sure of how they how their selection process works and who they determine who gets to go to support tier two elements versus tier one elements.\n\nSo the biggest difference between tier two and tier one selections is you're all your white SOF, your tier two, their selections are going to be where they're yelling at you, they're screaming at you, they're getting in your face, they are trying to break you mentally, and they have a lot more team oriented events. Tier one, they actually don't yell at you. They don't give you any negative reinforcement, but they don't give you any positive reinforcement. And I'll talk more later at the tier one selection video of why that is. And then also almost all their events are completely individual. You have very few to no team events in the tier one selections.\n\nAnd also another colloquialism that you're going to commonly hear is about assaulters or operators. So when you go to one of these units, especially the tier one units, you can either go to selection as a support personnel or as an operator, which also commonly known is, especially in SEAL Team Six or Delta, are also known as assaulters. So these are your operators, these are the guys who are on the ground who are doing the, you know, the main stuff and then everybody else is essentially a support personnel.\n\nAnd then these three operational tier one units, we also another colloquialism is used, is we use the task force colors which we were using in the early 2000s, probably into the mid 2000s, occasionally still use them when we're trying to determine who is who because a lot of times we'll go into meetings with other tier one elements and we're not in uniform. So as we're trying to figure out who is who because these units commonly change their operational names, we'll be kind of figure out who is who and then we'll be like, are you this color? Are you that color? So the three main colors for the three tier one units, uh Delta Force is green, SEAL Team Six is blue, and the activity is orange, or commonly known as TFO.\n\nSo I hope this was educational. Tomorrow I will put out part two of how tier two selections are generally run and what you need to know and what to do in order to help you pass a tier two selection. And then the part three will be about tier one and the differences, how they do their selections and how they um the best ways and advice that I have to pass them as well. So, hope this was informative. If you guys have any comments, complaints, questions, uh just leave a comment and just remember, at the end of the day, this is my opinion, nothing more than that. So if you disagree with my opinion, I got nothing for you.\n\nAll right, appreciate you guys.",
