    "Tier 2 units, also known as 'White SOF', include Rangers, Special Forces, MARSOC Raiders, Marine Force Recon, and non-DevGru SEAL teams.",
    "The speaker is a former Tier 1 operator who also served as a cadre/instructor for a Tier 1 selection, providing an insider's perspective on the process.",
    "Colloquial task force colors are used to identify Tier 1 units: Delta Force is Green, SEAL Team Six is Blue, and the Intelligence Support Activity is Orange (TFO)."
