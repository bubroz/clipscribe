## Executive Summary

This intelligence package details the formation of the band My Chemical Romance, originating from New Jersey. The band's creation was directly catalyzed by Gerard Way's experience witnessing the 9/11 attacks, which prompted him to shift from a career in comics to music. The core lineup consists of Gerard Way (vocals), Mikey Way (bass), Ray Toro (guitar), and Frank Iero (guitar). The report outlines the members' individual backgrounds in the local punk and hardcore scenes, including Ray Toro's time in The Rodneys and Frank Iero's influential band Pency Prep. The formation process involved Gerard recruiting initial drummer Matt Pelissier and convincing a disillusioned Ray Toro to join. Mikey Way coined the band's name and joined after hearing their first demos. Frank Iero joined last, following the dissolution of Pency Prep, bringing crucial connections that led to the band signing with Eyeball Records and recording their raw, heavy debut album, 'I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love,' in early 2002.
