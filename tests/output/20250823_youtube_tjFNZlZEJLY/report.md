## Executive Summary

A former Tier 1 Special Forces operator provides three key strategies for passing Tier 2 selection processes (e.g., SEALs, Rangers, Green Berets). The advice centers on arriving with specific physical fitness, particularly for rucking and water events; excelling as a quiet and reliable teammate in team-based evaluations; and maintaining unwavering mental fortitude to 'embrace the suck' and never quit. The speaker contrasts this with the more individual-focused nature of Tier 1 selections, which will be the subject of a future video.
