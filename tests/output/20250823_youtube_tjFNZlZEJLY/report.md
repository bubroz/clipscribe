## Executive Summary

A former Special Forces Tier One operator provides three key strategies for passing Tier Two selection courses (e.g., SEALs, Rangers, Green Berets). He emphasizes that candidates must: 1) achieve a specific type of fitness focused on rucking heavy weights and water competency, not just running; 2) be an exceptional, low-profile teammate, as selections are team-based and peer reviews can lead to dismissal; and 3) possess unwavering mental resilience to 'embrace the suck,' stay positive, and never quit. The speaker contrasts this with Tier One selections, which are more individual-focused.
