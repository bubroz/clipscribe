## Executive Summary

A former Tier One special forces operator and selection instructor provides three core tips for passing Tier Two special operations selections. He emphasizes that candidates must: 1) possess specific, functional fitness, particularly the ability to ruck heavy weights, not just run; 2) be an exceptional, low-profile teammate, as selections are team-based and often include peer reviews; and 3) develop extreme mental toughness to never quit and embrace the inherent misery of the process. The speaker contrasts Tier Two's team-oriented, negative-reinforcement model with Tier One's individual-focused approach.
