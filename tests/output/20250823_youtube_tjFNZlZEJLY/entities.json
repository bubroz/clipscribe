    "The three primary tips for passing Tier Two selections are: 1. Attain the right type of fitness (rucking, water competency), 2. Be a great teammate and avoid standing out for negative reasons, 3. Never quit and embrace the mental and physical misery of the course.",
    "Tier Two selections are characterized by negative reinforcement and team-oriented events, which contrasts with Tier One selections which are more individual and lack reinforcement.",
    "Physical fitness for Tier Two requires the ability to move heavy weights, primarily through rucking, which is described as a 'great equalizer' that can defeat even elite endurance athletes.",
    "Teamwork is critical in Tier Two selections; candidates can be 'peered out' and removed for being prima donnas or poor teammates.",
    "Mental resilience is paramount. Candidates must master their self-talk, stay positive, have a personal reason for being there, and take the selection one event at a time."
