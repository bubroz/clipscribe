    "The paramount advice for passing Tier Two selections is to never quit and to mentally embrace the designed misery of the process.",
    "Being a great teammate is critical in Tier Two selections, as they are team-oriented events where individuals can be removed based on peer evaluations.",
    "Tier Two selections are characterized by negative reinforcement and a focus on team events, distinguishing them from the individual-based Tier One selections.",
    "Appropriate physical fitness for Tier Two involves more than just running; it requires water competency and, crucially, the ability to move heavy weights, primarily through rucking.",
    "Candidates should adopt a 'gray man' approach: be reliable, punctual, and helpful without seeking the spotlight or causing drama."
