    "The speaker is a former Special Forces Tier 1 operator who also served as a cadre and instructor for a Tier 1 selection process.",
    "Tier 2 selections are fundamentally different from Tier 1, characterized by significant negative reinforcement and a strong emphasis on team-oriented events.",
    "The first major tip for passing Tier 2 selection is to possess the correct type of fitness, specifically being comfortable in water and capable of moving heavy weights, primarily through rucking.",
    "The second key tip is to be an excellent teammate, blend in as a 'gray man', and avoid negative attention, as peer performance is a critical evaluation factor.",
    "The third crucial tip is to never quit, embrace the inherent misery of the process, and maintain mental fortitude through positive self-talk and a clear personal motivation."
