    "description": "Part 2 of my 3-part series on passing Tier 1 and Tier 2 selections in U.S. Special Operations.\n\nToday we\u2019re breaking down how to pass Tier 2 selections\u2014for pipelines like Navy SEALs BUD/S, Army Ranger Assessment and Selection (RASP), Army Special Forces Selection (SFAS), MARSOC/Force Recon, and AFSOC JTAC/TACP selection.\n\nWhat\u2019s different about Tier 2 selection?\nTier 2 selections lean heavily on team events and deliberate stress. You will get yelled at. You will be tested in your ability to function under extreme physical and mental pressure\u2014especially as a teammate. They're actively trying to make you quit.\n\n\n---\n\nHere are my 3 key tips for passing Tier 2 selections:\n\n\u2705 1. Show Up Fit\u2014and the Right Kind of Fit\nDon\u2019t just be gym-fit. Be selection-fit. You need to move weight over distance. Rucking is the great equalizer\u2014train to the point you can run with a ruck. Lift weights so you know how to move load efficiently. Once the ruck is on, the clock doesn\u2019t stop, and nobody cares about your excuses.\n\n\n---\n\n\u2705 2. Don\u2019t Be a Tool\u2014Be a Teammate\nAlways be reliable. Never be late. Always have the right gear. Help your team without making it about you. They\u2019re looking for teammates\u2014not prima donnas, not lone-wolf superstars. Remember: you can get peered out if your team doesn\u2019t want to work with you.\n\n\n---\n\n\u2705 3. Never Quit\u2014Embrace the Misery\nThese selections are designed to make you want to quit. Don\u2019t avoid discomfort in training\u2014seek it out so you\u2019re ready for it. Embrace the misery. Stay positive no matter what. Master your self-talk. Don\u2019t let your mind turn on you. Know exactly why you\u2019re there\u2014and make sure you\u2019re doing it for you.\n\n\n---\n\nIf you're serious about making it through selection, remember: it\u2019s not about being the toughest guy in the gym\u2014it\u2019s about being the most dependable, resilient, and unbreakable when everything goes to hell.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Check out Part 1 of this series where I break down the differences between Tier 1 and Tier 2 units. And stay tuned for Part 3, where we\u2019ll talk about how to pass Tier 1 selection.\n\n#SpecialOperations #specialforces #military  #Tier2Selection #SOFPrep #ArmyRangers #GreenBerets #NavySEALs #MARSOC #JTAC #EmbraceTheSuck #NeverQuit #TeamFirst #life #success #inspiration #motivation"
