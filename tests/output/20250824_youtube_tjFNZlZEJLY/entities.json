    "The second tip is to be a great teammate, as Tier Two selections are team-oriented and candidates can be removed by their peers for poor teamwork.",
    "The third tip is to never quit, embrace the misery of the process, and maintain mental discipline through positive self-talk.",
    "Tier Two selections are characterized by negative reinforcement and a focus on team-based events, contrasting with the individual focus of Tier One.",
    "Candidates should adopt a 'gray man' approach, being reliable and helpful without drawing unnecessary attention to themselves."
