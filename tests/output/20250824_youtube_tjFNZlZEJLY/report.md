## Executive Summary

A former Tier One operator and selection instructor provides three key tips for passing Tier Two special operations selections (e.g., SEALs, Rangers, Green Berets). He emphasizes that these selections are defined by negative reinforcement and team-based challenges. The core advice is to: 1) achieve a high level of functional fitness, focusing on rucking and water competency; 2) be an excellent, low-profile teammate, as peer evaluation is critical; and 3) develop extreme mental toughness to never quit, embracing the difficulty and maintaining a positive mindset.
