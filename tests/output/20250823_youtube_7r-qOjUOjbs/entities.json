    "Tier one selections are fundamentally different from tier two, focusing on individual events with no positive or negative reinforcement and unknown evaluation criteria.",
    "The primary goal of tier one selection is to assess an individual's mental independence, problem-solving ability, and leadership capacity in solo, high-stakes environments.",
    "Three critical skills for passing are superior ruck running ability, expert-level land navigation (terrain association), and immense mental preparedness for stress and ambiguity.",
    "Candidates are often placed in 'no-win scenarios' to evaluate their decision-making process and resilience, where being decisive is more important than the outcome.",
    "Extreme physical preparation is mandatory, as the physical stress is immense and causes many experienced tier two operators to fail."
