  "key_facts": [
    "Tier One selections primarily consist of individual events, unlike Tier Two, to assess a candidate's ability to operate alone.",
    "The psychological approach in Tier One selection is different; there is no yelling or reinforcement, and evaluation criteria are kept secret, which psychologically challenges candidates more than overt pressure.",
    "Tier One selection tests the ability to lead a mission or operate solo without backup, focusing on problem-solving and mental agility, not just surviving hardship.",
    "Three critical skills for passing Tier One selection are: advanced ruck running ability, expert-level land navigation (specifically terrain association), and mental independence with strong decision-making skills.",
    "Candidates are deliberately placed in no-win scenarios to evaluate their decisiveness and performance under extreme, ambiguous stress."
