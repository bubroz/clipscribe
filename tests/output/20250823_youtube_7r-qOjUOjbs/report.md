## Executive Summary

A former Tier One operator details the selection process for elite units like Seal Team 6, Delta Force, and the Intelligence Support Activity. The analysis contrasts Tier One selections with Tier Two, highlighting that Tier One is an individual-focused psychological assessment with unknown standards and no external reinforcement. It is designed to find operators who are mentally independent, decisive, and capable of solving complex problems alone. Success hinges on extreme physical conditioning, particularly ruck running, expert land navigation skills, and the mental resilience to perform under immense, ambiguous pressure.
