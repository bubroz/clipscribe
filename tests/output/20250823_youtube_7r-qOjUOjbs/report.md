## Executive Summary

A former Tier One operator and selection cadre outlines the key differences and requirements for passing Tier One selections for units like Seal Team 6, Delta Force, and the Intelligence Support Activity. Unlike Tier Two, Tier One selections are almost entirely individual events with no positive or negative reinforcement and unknown evaluation criteria. The process is designed to test mental agility, independent problem-solving, and decision-making under ambiguous stress, including no-win scenarios. The speaker identifies three crucial areas for success: mastering high-speed ruck running, expert proficiency in land navigation (especially terrain association), and developing mental independence and resilience.
