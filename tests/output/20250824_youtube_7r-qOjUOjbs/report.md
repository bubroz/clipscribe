## Executive Summary

A former Tier 1 operator provides an in-depth analysis of the selection process for elite units such as Delta Force, SEAL Team 6, and the Intelligence Support Activity. The speaker contrasts Tier 1 selection with Tier 2, highlighting its focus on individual events, psychological resilience, and independent problem-solving under ambiguous conditions without reinforcement. Key prerequisites for success include elite-level ruck running, expert land navigation skills, and the mental fortitude to make decisive choices in no-win scenarios, with the overall goal of identifying operators who can function autonomously in high-stakes environments.
