    "The three key skills required to pass Tier 1 selections are advanced ruck running, expert-level Land Navigation, and a high degree of mental independence and resilience.",
    "Unlike Tier 2, Tier 1 selections are comprised almost entirely of individual events with no negative or positive reinforcement, and candidates are unaware of the evaluation criteria.",
    "In no-win scenarios presented during selection, making a decisive choice and following through is critically important, as indecisiveness is a major point of failure.",
    "Delta Force selection, nicknamed 'The Long Walk', is noted for its extremely difficult terrain in West Virginia, requiring advanced terrain association skills for Land Navigation."
