    "full_text": "Um, The Black Parade is the name of our new album coming out in October. The Black Parade is also the name of our alter ego on this record. Um, this was a really difficult record to make and there was a certain point where it was so dark for us that it felt like we needed to become much more than brothers. We had to be there for each other in many more ways. And we also needed to become a new band. Normally a band says that every time they make a record and in some ways they become a new band, but we really did it this time and became a different band. Um, but you know, make no mistake, we are my chemical Romance still. The year is 2006. Alternative culture is at an all-time high with many new breakout stars and bands taking the world by storm. All with swoopy hair, emotive lyrics and whiny post-hardcore music. Though, there is a bit of a change that's taking the entire scene by storm. One that's challenging the status quo. Bands are either warping their styles to be more pop and dressing in more contemporary clothes to appeal to a wider scene of people, or they're darkening their sounds and making far more obtuse and intense songs. With lyrics that are much more personal and gut-wrenching than what we may have seen previously. So, being that you are the most popular band and the fastest rising act of this entire little niche, what do you do to both make something fresh and new while also trying to stay at the top of your game? That's pretty simple actually. You release one of the most popular and influential rock albums of the 2000s. Ah, yes, the Black Parade. An album that is unparalleled in its ability to spark conversation. Just about anyone who's walked the earth in the past 18 parade. An album that is unparalleled in its ability to spark conversation. Just about anyone who's walked the earth in the past 18 years has heard at least one song off this album. And in general, it's a love it or hated affair. By the time 2006 rolled around, MCR had become the next big thing. They were seen as the front runners of the new wave of alternative music, alongside bands like Fall Out Boy and even Avenged Sevenfold. So the pressure was on for them to really take things to the next level, a task much easier said than done, especially when you consider just how big a leap Three Cheers had been. Not only for just MyChem themselves, but for the whole emo wave at large, as that album more or less opened the flood gates for smaller artists of that time to start getting much more mainstream attention and recognition than ever before. All of this led to a bit of a boiling point, however. After wrestling with their personal demons of addiction and poverty, and fighting tooth and nail just to hit it big with their first two records, the now famous My Chemical Romance was in a prime position to move forward. And being that this would be album 3, they also knew that releasing an album in the same style that they had been working with wouldn't really cut it here. And this would spark a bit of a dilemma that would put them between a rock and a hard place. Because a gamble needed to be made. Do they take a massive risk for high rewards and accolades, or do they just do a safe bet and just coast? Ride the wave that they were on until the star fades. But as history goes, they would actually opt to take the bet rather than play it safe. They put all their chips down and they bet it all on black. So, why don't we talk about that? Without further ado, why don't we talk about the haunting beauty of My Chemical Romance's Black Parade.\nWhen I was a young boy, my father took me into the city to see a marching band. He said, son, when you grow up, will you be the savior of the broken, the beaten and the damned?\n\nUh, you played a couple of small club shows. What happened to you become Uh, you played a couple of small club shows. What happened to you? You've become the the biggest thing in in the world. Thank you. Uh, that's flattering to hear. Uh um, what what happened? Let's see. Uh, we just simply didn't stop. Uh, we finished touring. That was to be the end really of touring that had started since the band got in a van. So we're talking at that point I guess two and a half straight years of touring, maybe three. Um, we stopped and instead of like resting for a prolonged amount of time, we just had the holidays off and then got back in a practice space in New York together and made the record of our dreams. Um, we tried to make something really honest, really progressive, um, really special and really pure and to make one of the loudest forms of uh self-expression that um we had heard in a long time. So. Coming off the success of Three Cheers, My Chemical Romance had entered into an entire other world. No longer bumming it out in vans and playing to bars and small venues. Gerard and crew were now bussing it across the entire world, headlining festivals, selling out theaters, and rolling in cold hard cash as well as endorsements from major brands. From the outside, you would expect all this success to be met with a sense of accomplishment and pride. But instead, it would end up building a harrowing emotion within the band. And that would be the pressure to really produce and create something that could not only make their fans happy, but top what they had already done. But as the old adage goes, you can't produce a diamond without pressure. And this circumstance would be more or less what propelled the band to push so far ahead of what they had previously done. Where three cheers took what was built on bullets and refined and polished the sound into something much bigger, the Black Parade would more or less have to be a complete reinvention on every level. And this would even include what we would see on the surface. While I will get more in-depth on aesthetics later on in the video, they started out by shifting the colorful flamboyance that they were known for and traded it for a monochrome uniformity. and began flipping the script on just about all of their past work. The last two records had focused on trying to innovate and bring new elements to what was at the time a burgeoning new sound. For album three, they would take the opposite approach. Gerard and Ray in particular would look to the past for inspiration, deciding on taking key influence from the theatrical glam rock artists of the 70s and 80s. In particular, David Bowie, but most predominantly Queen. Queen influence from the theatrical glamrock artists of the 70s and 80s. In particular, David Bowie, but most predominantly Queen. Queen's influence can be heard from start to finish on the Black Parade. But another artist that would really come into high gear for them there would be Pink Floyd. They would take a lot of conceptual elements from their music and structuring from their songs. And Pink Floyd would also be one of the bands that they would pay homage to directly by doing a shot-for-shot recreation of the opening scene of the wall in their video for teenagers. Black Parade would also be very notable as it would be the only record to feature drummer Bob Brier. who, outside of his ability to make family breakfast a great time for everyone, the drumming style that he would bring to the table would really help this new sound land. As previous drummer Matt's style was much more in line with punk and hardcore, and was much faster and flashier than really what would feel right on a record that's more focused on a glam and soft structure. So, Bob bringing a more simplistic and softer sound to the drumming, acting more as a background and backbone to the rest of the instruments, would fit really well and really help the Black Parade nail its sound. The album was written and demoed in the famous Paramore Mansion, an infamous location for both of its statuses as a haunted estate and also a historical landmark. The mansion was originally the home of silent film actor Antonio Moreno and his family. That was until his wife died in a car accident. Since then, it's seen quite a few different uses over the last 100 years or so. Back in the 50s, it would be converted into a home for girls run by nuns. But later, it would become a popular spot for filming, being featured in both Halloween H2O, as well as Scream 3 being filmed on location. And many other TV series and music videos, including the likes of Britney Spears, would be shot there as well. My romance would end up renting part of the mansion for the demoing process of their record, and a more perfect location couldn't exist. A haunted mansion marked with old film history, tragedy, and immortalized by horror movies is the exact kind of place that you would expect a band like My Chemical Romance to record. It's similar to how Trent Resner chose to write and record the downward is the exact kind of place that you would expect a band like My Chemical Romance to record. It's similar to how Trent Reznor chose to write and record The Downward Spiral in the Tate murder house. Was it kind of tasteless? Sure. But it fit the vibe perfectly for what they were trying to do and is the kind of thing that you would expect out of an eclectic person like Trent Reznor. The mansion would deeply influence the direction that the band would take with their tone and overall atmosphere of the music.\n\nRight away, it felt like this place was going to consume you, and eventually it would. There were so many hallways that seemed to lead somewhere very dark, stairways that led to places that were very cold, and the whole place was cold. The whole place seemed haunted. We figured this would work for us. We all drew numbers to see who got which room, and it almost seemed like the house chose which one we got, because each room would really fit each guy. Except Mikey. His room was terrifying to be in, and I couldn't exactly tell you why. It just had a vibe to it. The next day, our gear arrived and we set up. You could tell no one had slept very well on the account of the cold or the fact that you always felt like someone was watching you.\n\nThe track Sleep, in particular, would include a recording of Gerard talking about his experiences in the mansion.\n...they're not like tremors, they're worse than tremors, they're they're these terrors... every night... they're not like tremors, they're worse than tremors, they're they're these terrors... feel like in my... gripping my throat, squeezing.\nMentioning his nightmares, sleep paralysis, and feelings as if he was being strangled.\nFrank would also mention his own experiences in an interview.\nI heard things, but I just thought it was like a raccoon in the walls or something. And I heard later I found out later that um, that Merle Haggard had stayed in my room when he was making a record. And he was visited by what he said was a spirit, uh, of a young lady, and they would write songs together in my room. Damn.\nI don't, I mean, I didn't meet her. Unless she was trapped in the walls and I was like, it's a fucking raccoon. Yeah, maybe, I don't know.\nThis fucker thinks I'm a raccoon.\nIf that was her, she has a terrible voice.\nBut like, I remember like, I read something about like Mikey was having a hard time, but I also like, I'm curious like because Gerard, like sleep came out of that too because of his like, what, night night terrors that he was having.\nThat, all right, so that's funny because uh, yeah, so Mikey freaked out. But I I think I really I really do think that, um, if there's is a spiritual, paranormal, like wavelength or something like that, I think it plays into things that are going on with you. You know what I mean? And is a spiritual paranormal like wavelength or something like that. I think it plays into things that are going on with you. You know what I mean? And and I think that's how it manifests itself, maybe. Uh but yeah, Mikey had a really rough time. Uh I know that he had to stay in in in G's room basically the whole time we were there. Um, G did have night terrors. I had uh I had I've experienced sleep paralysis only twice in my life. The the worst of it would end up coming for little old Mikey. as he had already been dealing with his own mental health issues at the time, and getting stuck in what the band claimed was the most haunted room in the mansion, while also writing and recording a depressing album about grief and death. Well, it all culminated in him having a bit of a breakdown and briefly leaving the band. Though he would end up coming back after he heard the track Famous Last Words, whose lyrics were partially written about him. Now, when demoing was complete and the album hit its full-on production stage, Rob Cavallo would come on board for producing. He was known for his work with the Goo Goo Dolls, a band whose influence was heard all over the softer side of the Black Parade, but Cavallo was also famous for working with Green Day on just about all of their standout albums, making him a great fit for a band like MCR who existed in both the more emotional rock category and the modern alternative scene. And his influence can be heard all over the place, helping to give a level of polish and professionalism that really allowed for the Black Parade to achieve its timeless sound. this record I feel the thing about My Chemical Romance is that every time they make a record, they jump very far ahead. It's not simply just the next record, but I feel that it's three jumps ahead sometimes. So, of course with this record, it's it's no different. And um it's almost as if we got in a time machine, made the sixth or seventh record. Um, the Black Parade is an epic theatrical, orchestral. orchestral big, big record. Um that, you know, is also a concept album that um has a very set story in it, but also as you listen to this record, the layers of that story peel away and what you're left with at the end is a story about mortality and our own mortality. Now, before we get into the album, we do need to talk about its story. As the Black Parade is probably the most cohesive and disciplined record by the band, at least in terms of its story to the listener. Both Bullets and Three Cheers were also conceived as concept records, but if you've listened to them or even just watched my previous videos, then you already know that Three Cheers were also conceived as concept records. But if you've listened to them or even just watched my previous videos, then you already know that they're loose at best and kind of just themed at worst. Because with both, only a handful of the songs play into their overall stories and almost all the other songs are more so just mired in the personal experiences and musings of Gerard. The Black Parade on the other hand, tells its story with just about every track on the album. And sure, Gerard's personal lyricisms and musing still show up, but they actually play into the story of the main character to the point where it never feels like it's taking away from the concept. Now, the story of the Black Parade is a tragedy. It's the tale of a man dying from cancer and entering the afterlife. reminiscing and reflecting on his life, relationships and where he's going now that he's dead. The title track, the Black Parade, references the way death appears to him. In the world of the record, when you die, you're taken into the afterlife by reliving your fondest memory. Even at the very beginning of the record, the album wastes absolutely no time in setting its tone for just how this story is going to play out. We start ironically enough with a track titled The End. The song picks up right as the narrator or as he's known in the story, the patient is experiencing some of his final moments. Reflecting that his time has come and in a sarcastic and rebellious fashion, mocks the very nature of grief and funeral traditions. Another contusion, my funeral jag. Here's my resignation, I'll serve it and drag. You've got front row seats to the penitence ball. When I grow up, I want to be nothing at all. The patient is mocking the entire idea of penitence or as we know it in layman's terms, regret and sorrow. And mocking the idea of death by calling it a resignation, telling us that he doesn't care to keep living and wishes to go out on his own terms. Even claiming that he never wanted to do anything with his life as he already knew he had absolutely no future. Where this parallels into real life, is that it's an intro statement from Gerard himself. He knew that the Black Parade would be one of those albums that the more hardcore purists out there and the already hypercritical music scene at large would more than likely take the band shift and sound and attack them for it. out there and the already hyper critical music scene at large would more than likely take the band shift and sound and attack them for it. And he eshews all of this, making it clear that not only does he not care what they think, he doesn't give a shit about their outrage either. And this is something even Frank had spoken about previously. There was a little less screaming and a little more melody, but it was still us. Never was it a case of, I don't put that melody here because hardcore Chuck who took me to my first show at Fairfield American Legion Hall is really going to be bummed at me. I don't give a shit. If I had to work at McDonald's for the rest of my life and play shows and ride in a shitty van on tour, I've done it and I'll do it again. And this intro statement is solidified come track two with one of the band's most iconic songs, Dead.\nSo tired and oh so squeamish. You never fell in love. Did you get what you deserve? The end of your life. And if you get to heaven, I'll be here waiting, babe.\nDead's verses are sung from the perspective of the patient's mother. A large part of this album's themes are derived from the strained and tumultuous relationship between her and the patient, where the chorus is from the patient's perspective, where we see him reviling in his lonely misery, accepting his fate, and begging the question on how great it would be if everyone joined him. And the song even reveals just how fast all this took place as the bridge includes the doctor revealing that upon inspection, the patient realistically only has two weeks left to live. Now, this is a lot of information to throw at the listener all at once. But it was done so intentionally. My Chemical Romance has a lot of inspiration, and one of the inspirations for me is David Bowie. My favorite Bowie song is off Ziggy, and it's Five Years. I wanted to start the record with that kind of energy, but I wanted it to convey right away in the very first song how over the top this experience is going to be. That kind of went so big and bombastic and dramatic and just kind of everything happening all at once. The band essentially wanted to bathe the listener in the fire by throwing a one two punch of melancholy and bombastic drama right at the start. With the end playing into the much more theatrical and classic rock lean sound of the record that it was taking influence from, and Dead showcasing the familiar sound of the previous records, but this time coded in the more pop and polished sound that The Black Parade is built on. From here, the record settles for a few tracks, showing off its sound and telling its story. This is how I disappear is a song where the patient writes a letter to a The record settles for a few tracks, showing off its sound and telling its story. This is how I disappear is a song where the patient writes a letter to a former lover where he laments but refuses to explain his unforgivable sins and essentially begs them to keep his memory alive. As without them, he would fade away. Can you hear me cry out to you? Words I thought I'd choke on, figure out. I'm really not so with you anymore. I'm just a ghost. So I can't hurt you anymore. Well, the meaning of the song is pretty clear, it's also referencing the old adage that you die twice. Once when you physically pass away, and the second when someone says your name for the last time. The lyrics were heavily inspired by the death of the famous magician, Houdini, who was known for his death defying stunts and ability to escape peril. After his death, his wife would hold seances to try and communicate with his ghost. The lyrics on the song are an ironic twist on this, where someone on their death bed is writing letters or having their own version of a seance, trying to speak with the living. Now, the next track, The Sharpest Lives serves as a bit of the other side of the coin to This is how I disappear where the patient finally speaks about his life of debauchery and alcoholism. Well it rains and it pours when you're out on your own. If I crash on the couch can I sleep in my clothes? Cause I spent the night dancing. I'm drunk I suppose. If it looks like I'm laughing, I'm really just asking to leave. This alone, you're in time for the show. You're the one that I need, I'm the one that you loathe. You can watch me corrode like a beast in repose, cuz I love all the poison away with the boys in the band. Alcohol and drug use don't mix well with childhood trauma. Something that the patient has dealt with, and we will find out about that later. But the key takeaway is that during his life, he indulged in his addictions. And if we take a look at verse two, it references lust and Juliet. Something we can speculate as either nodding to infidelity, or that the relationship with the lover was more convenience and addiction than love itself. Being both valid ideas if we take into account the previous track referenced that the patient hurt his lover, either through physical abuse or betrayal in the way of infidelity and cheating. The Sharpest Lives is one of the most direct songs from the album in regards to its transparency to Gerard's personal struggles, lamenting his time fighting his addictions, which were a consistent topic on both previous releases. Black Parade being the first album where he wrote it in a more sober state of mind. Now, it's after these three tracks that we finally meet the infamous G-note. Welcome to the Black Parade is not only one of the most famous songs from this album, but from this entire era. It was emo's very own Bohemian Rhapsody. with emotional lyrics, a song structure that feels like a journey, and the culmination of all the band's talents wrapped into a single masterpiece. Welcome to the Black Parade is also the cornerstone of which the album is built. It's where the name of the record and overall story we hear, a thematic through line is derived. The track details what the Black Parade is. In this case, it's a manifestation of the patient's fondest childhood memory, appearing here as a bit of a grim reaper of sorts to take the patient into the next life. Story-wise, we can see it as a song that brings context to what we've heard so far. The end and dead indicate the patient's diagnosis and his internal struggle with his mortality. This is how I disappear is a song that is pleading for someone to keep his memory alive once he's gone. And the sharpest lives is telling of the sins and mistakes of his life. Welcome to the Black Parade serves as not only world building, but the first sign of our main character being faced with the challenge of accepting his fate. And it's here where the album also lyrically takes a direct turn. A lot of the panic sadness that has been expressed across the album begins to shatter, and much of the remaining songs that follow explore the patient facing his trauma and regrets with a sense of anger, bitterness and solace as he slowly accepts his fate. The following track, I don't love you, is a prime example of this. The song is written the way that you would expect an upbeat love ballad to be, and it's also here where that previously mentioned Goo Goo Dolls influence really shows up. Sometimes I cry so hard from pleading. So sick and tired of all the needless beating. But baby, when they knock you down and out, it's where you ought to stay. And after all the blood that you still owe, another dollar is just another blow. So fix your eyes and get up. Better get up while you can. This song again, recontextualizes what came before, describing the tumultuous on and off relationship between the patient while you can. This song, again, recontextualizes what came before, describing the tumultuous on-and-off relationship between the patient and the lover that he wrote to in disappear, showing just how dysfunctional and broken that relationship really was, and further revealing the patient as this morally gray at best and outright repugnant at worst character. And this characterization of the patient is made even more transparent on House of Wolves, which is, according to the band, the patient's glimpse into hell as he lays on his deathbed where he ponders his innocence while relenting that he thinks he will go to hell, knowing that despite his delusions of grandeur and remorseless resolve, he's aware of the sins and the way that he lived his life. House of Wolves is also notable for being one of the biggest left turns on the record musically, keeping that fast-paced MCR sound, but recreating it in a way that sounds much more reminiscent to Stray Cats and Brian Setzer as a whole. Well, unlock the devil comes and never going to leave you alone. In the alley cause I'm never gonna find you a home. It's here in the record where we reach my two favorite songs off the album, the ones that to me encapsulate the magic of the whole record. And that would be Cancer and Mama. Now turn away. 'Cause I'm awful just to see 'cause all my hair's abandoned Cancer is a self-explanatory song where the patient begins to accept that he's hopeless in survival. The first verse of the song speaks on our protagonist wishing his family well, though still not being able to have the guts to kiss them goodbye. And verse two goes more in depth on just how badly the cancer has ravaged his body, leaving him resembling more of a corpse than a person. The song is just a heart-wrenching track that musically plays out as both a ballad and a constant buildup, starting with just Gerard singing over a piano before the entire band and even an orchestra by the end. It really nails the feeling that this is our character's end. He's in his final moments of life wrestling with all that entails, melancholically musing on what's happening to him, eschewing a lot of poetics in favor of being very matter of fact about the whole thing. And this lyrically and musically builds up to an extremely theatrical track and finale to this sort of thinking. And that's Mama. Well mother, what the war did to my legs and to my tongue. You should have raised a baby girl, I should have been a better son if you could. Well mother what the war did to my legs and to my tongue. You should have raised a baby girl, I should have been a better son. If you could counter the infection, they can amputate it once. You should have been! I could have been a better son! And when we came around.\nMama is a dramatic, flamboyant, and bombastic song, where we learn more lore and see the patient to finally revel in his repugnance and kind of learn about the root cause of all of it as we find out a lot more about the dynamic between the broken relationship of his mom and get glimpses of what the war that he served in did to him.\nAnd when we go, don't blame us. We'll let the fires just bathe us. You made us oh so famous. We'll never let you go. She said you ain't no son of mine. For what you've done, they're going to find a place for you and just your mind. Your manners when you go, and when you go, don't return to me, my love.\nThe song gives us a little bit of the details behind the patient's past as a soldier, scarred and injured in a war, left as a killer in the eyes of his own mother. And it's easy to see just how this once again recontextualizes everything that we've heard up to this point. With the patient's experiences at war possibly leaving him with PTSD and other mental struggles. It also explains why in the song Dead, well, why his mother essentially taunted him in his peril, claiming that he would get what he deserved, because in her eyes, in her view, her baby boy died in that war and all that's left of him is a killer. And well, it's this, that feeling of rejection by the person who's supposed to love you no matter what, the person who's supposed to be your mother, leaving you on a path of remorseless anger, refusing to accept the wrongs that you've committed in the face of an accusatory figure who in your eyes is meant to accept you no matter what.\nThat is what really defines the patient and his repugnant and disgusting past that we hear about in regards to his previous relationships, his own self views, and everything else. And this is all culminated and plays directly into the next song, Sleep, which in many ways can be seen as the patient's true death in the story.\n...say that I'm sorry for what I've done! We ran through it all! And couldn't you cry for me... because I don't feel bad about it at all!\nSleep is another one of the standouts on The Black Parade and MCR's discography as a whole. It's a powerful, anthemic song that is both uplifting in its sound... out on The Black Parade and MCR's discography as a whole. It's a powerful anthemic song that is both uplifting in its sound, but biting and callous in its lyrics.\nSome say now suffer all the children and walk away a savior, or a madman and polluted from gutter institutions. Don't you breathe for me, undeserving of your sympathy, cuz there ain't no way that I'm sorry for what I did.\nThe lyrics here find the patient accepting himself fully as an unsympathetic beast, but also as a person who has no regret or remorse for what he has done in his life. Understanding that some will see him a hero and some will see him as nothing more than a monster. His apathy lying in the fact that he has resolved himself to his fate and death, and even in his belief that he will burn in hell. Hence the chorus and title of the song being Sleep. In many ways, it actually reminds me of one of my favorite quotes from my all-time favorite movie.\nIn the film Oldboy, our main character is a likable yet flawed man who ends up being trapped in an unfair and awful fate, only to be released from it to suffer more. Blamed for crimes and sins he didn't commit, though as we learn more about him, we see he isn't the most savory person after all. And like the patient has led a less than savory life. If you're familiar with the film, then you know this is the only real similarity between the patient and Odesu, with their circumstances and actions being far different and very uncomparable. But the movie does have a reoccurring phrase that reminds me a lot of the song Sleep and the patient as a whole. And that would be, even though I'm no better than a beast, don't I have the right to live?\nFrom here, we hit the ending stretch of the record. And the song I shit on two years ago, and I still stand with my initial opinion on. Teenagers is a song that is both beloved and reviled depending on who you ask. It's one of the radio singles and in general, it's one of the weakest off the record. Its lyrics have little to no relation to the overall story, and it's mostly a track where Gerard speaks on his negative experiences as a teenager. He never outright states this. It's also probably a product of how he felt about his own fans at times.\nTeenagers is by no means a bad song. Honestly, its biggest sin is just being sandwiched here at the end of the record and just feeling as out of place as it is considering it has basically fuck all to do with the actual album. And in general is just it's just okay. It's mid on an album that has otherwise been fantastic. basically fuck all to do with the actual album. And in general is just it's just okay. It's mid on a album that has otherwise been fantastic. Now, disenchanted on the other hand is a far different story. Disenchanted serves as the final acceptance of death where the patient leaves himself in a place where he not just relents life but also finds that it's overrated. It's an apathetic ballad and a track laced with beautiful and uplifting music, fused with poisonous and bitter lyrics. And while this would be a truly depressing note to end off the record with, it's mostly here to serve as the calm before the storm. The build to the finale. And what a finale we have ahead. The final song on the record that closes out our story is the open-ended conclusion, famous last words. The track is an explosive and uplifting song musically. But where many of the previous songs in the style have maintained lyrics that contrast with their tone. Famous Last Words is a song about hope and acceptance. Cuz I see you lying next to me with words I thought I'd never speak. Awake and unafraid. Asleep or dead. I'm not afraid to keep on living. I'm not afraid to walk this world alone. Honey, if you stay, you'll be forgiven. Nothing you can say can stop me going home. The lyrics show that the journey that the patient has gone on has in fact not left him apathetic after all, but rather joyous and brave in his final passing. Moving forward despite all he's been through and encouraging those who hear him that if they join him on the other side, they'll be forgiven. And despite all he has seen, he's not afraid to keep moving forward. It really gives the album an uplifting and powerful conclusion where we see that in the end, despite all the pain, despite all the trauma and the unfairness of the patient's life, he can still find peace at the end of the road. While most people take the song as being open-ended, I think it's a little obvious that this is the patient accepting his death and passage to the afterlife. With the references to being on the uh quote other side and the inner peace he found, I think it's accepting his death and passage to the afterlife. With the references to being on the uh, quote, other side and the inner peace he found, I think it's safe to say that this is the end of his life, and he got what he deserved.\nWell I want to know what scares you. I want to go down right down the line. What scares you? Tons of things scare me. Yeah. Oh, I have I have what's it called? Uh, tryptophobia, which is the fear of needles. Yeah. Fear of needles. I'm afraid of large bodies of water and sharks. and ghosts. But his favorite movie is And my favorite movie's Jaws, though. of sharks. Um, it definitely, definitely has to be spiders, I would say, and like confined, confined spaces. Lots of claustrophobic stuff. Freaks you out. Yeah, it's not very good. Uh, large bodies of water and flying. Balconies and spiders. Balconies. Okay, that's a new one. And patience? I'm dead.\nNow, much like Three Cheers, the Black Parade's success was heavily predicated on the band's marketing and aesthetic. Where it actually differs is, well, in its devotion and discipline to the concept behind the album. The jump from Bullets to Three Cheers was one marked in maturity. It was the band going from minorly fitting the image behind their music, but still relatively looking like normal guys, to dressing up in color-matched outfits with a defined and unified aesthetic. But both these eras were distinctly defined by their at the time modern look with a comic book vampire aesthetic, veiled in deep reds and saturated colors, reminiscent of what you would see in the pages of books like Hellboy or 30 Days of Night. The Black Parade on the other hand really eschews all the flamboyant flair and vibrancy and trades it in for a monochrome color palette. And again, a uniformity, but this one with actual uniforms. During this era, much of the band would mostly clean up their punkish look and while they still looked mostly alternative in their fashion, they would don more traditional aesthetics and each wear black marching band uniforms, fully embracing their characters that they play on the record by becoming the Black Parade themselves.\nThis was a really difficult record to make and there was a certain point where it was so dark for us that it felt like we needed to become much more than brothers. We had to be there for each other in many more ways and we also needed to become a new band. Um, normally a band says that every time they make a record and in some ways they become a new band, but we really did it this time and became a different band. Um, but, you know, make no mistake, we are my chemical romance still. It's just our alter ego for this record.\nThey would even market some of their tours on the record by calling themselves the Black Parade, ra we are my chemical romance still. It's just our alter ego for this record. They would even market some of their tours on the record by calling themselves the Black Parade rather than My Chem. Something met with mixed reception, but a bold choice nonetheless. By essentially recreating themselves from the ground up for this record, they were making a statement similar to what's heard on the end. They didn't care if people accepted it or not, or if people felt betrayed by the new direction they chose to go in. They were fully committed to this project and willing to experiment and shift everything about themselves, as long as it served for the promotion and experience of the album, even if that meant alienating their audience. Something that really shows this off best is the artwork around the record, featuring illustrations showing the imaginative and harrowing depictions of the patient and the world that he existed in. All this was done by James Jean, who would go on to work with Gerard on Umbrella Academy doing all the covers. Which works really well here since his style and entire way of doing things kind of creates this odd feeling where it both feels fresh and new and very stylized the 2000s while also retaining this very old school and almost 1800s vibe to everything, making every character and every page that he makes really seem timeless and essentially ambiguous as to what time period it takes place in. Now, in the previous video, we talked a lot about the music videos that were produced for Three Cheers and just how much they really paid the path heavily for the band to find popularity with how theatrical and well-made they were. And the Black Parade is no different. But in many ways, it feels like a complete inversion as to what was done in the past. Aside from teenagers, which was the final music video produced for the record and also the most disconnected song from the overall tone of the story, all the other music videos are completely divorced from the heavily saturated and vibrant color scheme of the past videos. And especially when compared to the really flamboyant and colorful style of what would come later. The live video for Dead as well as the music video for I don't love you were shot in black and white with more simplistic videos than much of what the band had already done. And while some may see this as a step down, it's as I've said more times than I should have by this point, disciplined and in service to the concept. Letting the songs that have more bright and cheery sounds, keep the grim and depressing tone of their lyrics. I don't love you in particular looks like it could have come out of almost any decade from the 80s, the 90s, the 2000s or even the 2010s. Maybe even I don't love you in particular, looks like it could have come out of almost any decade from the 80s, the 90s, the 2000s, or even the 2010s. Maybe even the 2020s in some degrees. And that's all due to the very simplistic and more minimal way that it's shot and framed, especially with that black and white color scheme. Compare this to the previously mentioned teenagers, which is not really trying to do any of that, and teenagers very much looks like a mid 2000s music video. especially with the way that it's color graded and the contrast and the saturation. It it looks great and I actually do like the video for teenagers despite my distaste for the song. But it fits well, but that's the thing. It fits well for its time, which was the kind of case for a lot of music videos from bigger bands during this period. I mean, look at any Panic at the Disco video or even Fall up boy video and they very much look like the mid 2000s. Which is frankly something that can be said about the other two videos for Black Parade. But that doesn't mean that they're not great. Welcome to the Black Parade and Famous Last Words are the other two videos that really focus on telling the story of the record rather than just fitting the tone like Dead and I don't love you do. And these videos go hand-in-hand with one another and can really be seen as a two-parter, telling the full story of the record in a much more condensed fashion. While Welcome to the Black Parade is not in black and white, it is color graded in a way that keeps the monochrome motif going on. The entire thing is very muted and gray, and even the vibrant colors that do pop through like the reds still show themselves as very muted and drab. And it goes to serve just how cold and lifeless the events sung about actually are. The whole thing has a very Tim Burton vibe to it. and given the large crossover of my chemical Romance and Tim Burton's fan bases. I can't sit here and pretend like this is just a coincidence and it's more than likely the direct intention. Now, famous last words on the other hand is probably the most vibrant of all the videos. While its colors are still relatively muted, only really adding some more browns to the color palette and the fire as we watch the float in many of the props in the previous video burn, signifying the culmination of the acceptance that is spoken about in the lyrics, it does serve as a whole to really feel like the finisher of the record or the finisher of the story in this case since it was the second music video. And it was this brave shift in tone and aesthetic, much like with three cheers, that would end up doing a lot to really push the band forward and bring them a ton of new fans and credibility. The best way to put it is the videos along with the album itself feel timeless. They're classic, yet fresh. And this was the intention, according to Ray Toro. Something that 20 or 30 years from now, parents could play with their kids and say, \"This was what I was listening to when I was your age. Check it out. It's still cool.\" We wanted to make a record you could pass down. There's a lot of music out now that just doesn't feel like that.\n\nYes. Uh, Bob got a third degree burn. I got torn ligaments. It was a really, here's what happened. We shot two videos back to back. The second video involved a lot of fire. And we were very close to the fire, and it made us a little nuts. It definitely got like Lord of the Flies at certain points and dudes were definitely trying to kill each other. Um, You had to be there. You had to really be\u2014 when you see it, I think it makes more sense, but um, yeah, we got really injured. Uh, I'm still walking with a cane. Bob's burn is now infected, I believe. Yeah. So, It's like green and black. It's awful. It's green. It's green and black. Yeah. Yeah. Right? That's what he said. Yeah. He said he's going to try to cut out the infection with a knife. A knife. I don't know.\nThe Black Parade can easily be seen as the band's highest point. It was their highest level of production and it's a record that propelled them even further into the mainstream than even Three Cheers did. While that album transformed MCR from a small underground act to MTV heroes, championing the whole alternative wave, Black Parade pushed them into a full-on mainstream and turned them into, well, as much as you're going to puke me saying this, pop stars.\nWhile at large, they were still seen as the emo band, who stood as the kings of the whole Mall Goth wave. It was during this point where tracks like Dead! and Welcome to the Black Parade would really dominate radio waves, and people even far removed from the whole emo/scene thing would really begin to start listening to them, which is something you can see now at all the Emo Nites across America, where Kyles and Stephanies everywhere who thought this was the lamest shit back in the day, now get to cosplay as the emo teenagers they always wished they were.\nNow, this catapult into the mainstream would see My Chemical Romance enter the arena rock realm of artists, as well as becoming a staple headliner across the world's various festivals. Predominantly Download, Big Day Out, Reading, all that sort of stuff. But with all the success, it's not to say that everything was sunshine. predominantly download, Big Day out, Reading, all that sort of stuff. But with all the success, it's not to say that everything was sunshine and rainbows. For years there had been a slow- brewing resentment for the band that had just been growing. And around this time was when that bubble finally started to burst. One of the funniest and first big controversies would be the mostly forgotten and one-sided beef the band had with Marilyn Manson. Around this time Manson would make it a bit of a habit to shit on the band and accuse them of ripping him off, which would as obvious as it can be, instigate a media shit storm where tabloids and magazines pretending that they aren't tabloids would feel the fire. Which would culminate in rumors and gossip running rampant and weaponizing the two artists fan bases to go to war with each other. One of the funniest bits being this horribly aged article from Metal Sucks, which includes this wonderful and poetic bit here. At the time, we wrote it off as typical Manson shit slinging for publicity sake. He did have a new album coming out after all. But it wasn't until last night that Manson's true motivation for taking aim at MCR singer Gerard Way and his band suddenly dawned on us. Manson's girlfriend, Evan Rachel Wood has appeared in the music videos for Manson's own heart-shaped glasses and My Chemical Romance's the ghost of you. Could it be that Manson isn't the first goth rocker to give Evan Rachel his wood? Given the various lawsuits regarding Rachel and Brian, I'm sure that the stunning and brave author of this wonderfully written article is just reveling in its bad taste. But hey, regardless, it also references what is possibly the most well-known bit of beef between the two, which is the song alleged to be about Micam titled Mutilation is the most sincere form of flattery. Hey, there's no rules today. You steal instead of borrow. You take all the shapes that I make and think that you think all the thoughts that I thought you, don't you? The song's original title was Rebel without applause. And while it doesn't specifically reference the band, to anyone looking to shoehorn drama and taking note of Manson's comments regarding them, it's easy to see how this would be misconstrued that way, especially when the title was changed to reference self-mutilation, which was another big controversy and stereotype regarding the Mica romance fan base. Though, Manson in an interview would sit there and backpedal claiming that the song wasn't about the band, though he did still take some pot shots at Frank. Uh, are you still fighting with my Chemical romance? I never was fighting with them, but we did a show with them in uh, was it? Like Norway? Right. And one of the guys, the guitar player, I never was fighting with them, but we did a show with them and uh, where was it? like Norway. Right. And one of the guys, the guitar player came up and he cause he's a dwarf, legally. There's a law against dwarfs. And he was like, he came up to like my chest bone because I'm like 700 feet tall and he's like two feet tall. And uh he uh said to me, I'd really like to apologize for things and I said it's a good thing. because I would have beat him down like a bitch. But um, I never tried to instigate something with them. to me it's it's I'm not trying to complain. Everybody was like, did you write that song about My Chemical Romance? I'm like, no. you know, so it was something the press tried to instigate. But to me, My Chemical Romance, it's just kind of not not something I like. I don't care. And I told him, I'm like, yeah, I have no problem with you, but I don't like you. Happy birthday.\n\nGerard and crew would opt to remain mostly silent over all of this, with Gerard himself just saying, We still haven't found someone that has knocked us down that we need to take seriously. If Elvis Costello said we sucked, we would think about it a bit, but usually it's comments from someone with a new record to promote, so the comments ring hollow. Now, what would still ring hollow but did hit a bit closer to home was the next beef that the band would fall into. This time with previous to best friends forever, The Used. As we spoke about in the last video, The Used was a band that was very close with MCR, particularly the homoerotic friendship between Gerard and Bert, which was publicized heavily and intertwined the two bands' fan bases and overall image more than their actual collaboration on songs did. So, smoke found between these two would hit a lot harder than any mainstream rock icon who's washed up and just trying to get press ever could. The beef between Gerard and Bert is actually a pretty simple affair to break down. The pair's friendship was heavily reliant on their shared use of alcohol and narcotics. And like most chemically dependent relationships, once one of them sobers up, it's not likely that the friendship will survive. And such a case seemed to happen. And around this same time, My Chemical Romance essentially left The Used in the dust popularity-wise. In the really early 2000s when the bands met, The Used was a far bigger and far more popular band than MCR. But after the smash success that came with Three Cheers, the tables would really begin to turn. And as that friendship began to fade and the seeds of jealousy and envy began to grow, especially when all the lashings out of Bert by throwing digs in interviews and his pathetic attempts at IRL trolling. and the seeds of jealousy and envy began to grow, especially when all the lashings out of Bert by throwing digs in interviews and his pathetic attempts at trolling by picketing the band sets would only result in further distaste by the greater fan base at large. The drama and resentment would ultimately lead Bert to penning the timeless classic, pretty handsome awkward. He would constantly hint but never confirm that the song was about way. And just like Manson, the lyrics are easy to read into the idea of them actually being about him. Only for Bert, like Manson to just be a massive fucking pussy about the whole thing and claim that the song wasn't about to roar. Though him doing dumb shit like this over 10 years after the beef. Only to follow it up by begging to be an opener for the band before they're even back together while then going right back to bitching and moaning. Well, I think it's safe to say that he's still bitter about it. Was the OASIS that good, Bert? Come on, you can tell us. Is that why you're so upset? Well, I'm sure I'm missing some side quests here and there. Uh, you know, because around this time everyone was taking pot shots and attacking the band. The last really big controversy that actually mattered and wasn't just from some nobody bitching would be the media fire storm that the British rags, the Daily Mail and the Guardian unleashed. These two would weaponize Karens everywhere by spending multiple years writing hit pieces on the band and about how their fans were a bunch of self-harming cultists. This would end up in a actual protest march in support of the band and while overall this controversy and relative slander would end up feeding into obscurity and being seen as a puritanical joke like Jack Thompson's crusade against video games back in the day, at the time, it was a big deal. and only embolden the tractors and critics of MCR and the greater emo scene of the era. But as it stands, My Chemical Romance would still end up on top. with their star only continuing to rise and their prominence in pop culture being all but cemented as these sorts of attacks on artists typically end with them being immortalized as rebels. The same way it did for many of the artists who came before them. The success of the Black Parade and cultural dominance that's still felt by it today, is rebels. The same way it did for many of the artists who came before them. The success of the Black Parade and cultural dominance that's still felt by it today has never come close to wavering. And in 2008 to cap off the era, My Chemical Romance would film their live DVD The Black Parade is dead. ending the era and cementing it as an all-time classic. Though, the years following this would result in some of the most tumultuous and unstable years in their band's career. as success isn't always what it's all cracked up to be, especially when your mental health and your desire to do something else really begins to take over. And well, if I get any further, we'll get into spoiler territory for next time. So with that, I'll just say, that's another video for another day.

The album is a theatrical rock opera about a character named 'The Patient' dying of cancer. Influenced heavily by 70s glam rock acts like Queen and David Bowie, the band adopted an alter-ego for the record. The album was demoed in the haunted Paramore Mansion, an experience that deeply affected the band members, contributing to the album's dark atmosphere and causing bassist Mikey Way to have a breakdown. Produced by Rob Cavallo, the album marked a significant musical evolution for the band and became one of the most influential rock albums of the 2000s.",
