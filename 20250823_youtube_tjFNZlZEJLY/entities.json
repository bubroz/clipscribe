  "key_facts": [
    "Passing Tier 2 selections requires a combination of specific physical fitness (rucking, lifting heavy weights), being an excellent teammate, and possessing extreme mental resilience to never quit.",
    "Tier 2 selections are fundamentally different from Tier 1, emphasizing team-oriented events and using negative reinforcement to break down candidates.",
    "Being a 'gray man'\u2014a reliable, helpful, and low-profile teammate\u2014is crucial, as candidates can be removed based on peer evaluations.",
    "Mental fortitude, including mastering positive self-talk and having a strong personal 'why,' is essential for enduring the designed misery of the selection process.",
    "Endurance running alone is insufficient; the ability to carry heavy loads (rucking) over distance is a great equalizer and a critical skill."
