    "description": "Part 2 of my 3-part series on passing Tier 1 and Tier 2 selections in U.S. Special Operations.\n\nToday we\u2019re breaking down how to pass Tier 2 selections\u2014for pipelines like Navy SEALs BUD/S, Army Ranger Assessment and Selection (RASP), Army Special Forces Selection (SFAS), MARSOC/Force Recon, and AFSOC JTAC/TACP selection.\n\nWhat\u2019s different about Tier 2 selection?\nTier 2 selections lean heavily on team events and deliberate stress. You will get yelled at. You will be tested in your ability to function under extreme physical and mental pressure\u2014especially as a teammate. They're actively trying to make you quit.\n\n\n---\n\nHere are my 3 key tips for passing Tier 2 selections:\n\n\u2705 1. Show Up Fit\u2014and the Right Kind of Fit\nDon\u2019t just be gym-fit. Be selection-fit. You need to move weight over distance. Rucking is the great equalizer\u2014train to the point you can run with a ruck. Lift weights so you know how to move load efficiently. Once the ruck is on, the clock doesn\u2019t stop, and nobody cares about your excuses.\n\n\n---\n\n\u2705 2. Don\u2019t Be a Tool\u2014Be a Teammate\nAlways be reliable. Never be late. Always have the right gear. Help your team without making it about you. They\u2019re looking for teammates\u2014not prima donnas, not lone-wolf superstars. Remember: you can get peered out if your team doesn\u2019t want to work with you.\n\n\n---\n\n\u2705 3. Never Quit\u2014Embrace the Misery\nThese selections are designed to make you want to quit. Don\u2019t avoid discomfort in training\u2014seek it out so you\u2019re ready for it. Embrace the misery. Stay positive no matter what. Master your self-talk. Don\u2019t let your mind turn on you. Know exactly why you\u2019re there\u2014and make sure you\u2019re doing it for you.\n\n\n---\n\nIf you're serious about making it through selection, remember: it\u2019s not about being the toughest guy in the gym\u2014it\u2019s about being the most dependable, resilient, and unbreakable when everything goes to hell.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Check out Part 1 of this series where I break down the differences between Tier 1 and Tier 2 units. And stay tuned for Part 3, where we\u2019ll talk about how to pass Tier 1 selection.\n\n#SpecialOperations #specialforces #military  #Tier2Selection #SOFPrep #ArmyRangers #GreenBerets #NavySEALs #MARSOC #JTAC #EmbraceTheSuck #NeverQuit #TeamFirst #life #success #inspiration #motivation"

    "full_text": "This is my second part of my three-part series on how to pass tier one to two so two selections. Today we're going to cover part two, which is how to pass tier two selections. So first, reiterate my background. I'm a former special forces tier one operator, and I also got to be a cadre and an instructor for a tier one selection.\n\nSo we're talking about tier two and how to pass tier two selections, which cover White SOF, which is your SEALs, or your vanilla SEALs, your MARSOC Raiders, your Marine Force Recon, your Rangers, your Green Berets, your AFSOC guys. So the main thing about tier two selections is there is a lot of negative reinforcement. They are trying to break you down, and there's a it's a lot of team-oriented events. These are the two things that separate it the most from tier one selections, because tier one is more individual, and actually they give you no, they don't give you any negative or positive reinforcement. I have three main tips on how to pass tier two selections. Tip one is be fit and show up with the right type of fitness, which means not just being good at running, you have to one, be familiar with the water. Not every selection involves water, but a lot of them do. And then two, you need to be able to move heavy weights. And what I mean by that is you need to learn how to lift. You lift heavy weights, but because most of what you are going to be doing is rucking. And if you don't know how to move with weight, you're screwed. I have seen so many guys who are like amazing ultra marathon runners, and it's the great equalizer. As soon as they throw a 50 60 pound ruck on their back, and then they're toast, and then they're just falling behind on everybody. If you can, learn how to ruck run. It's not as important in tier two selections. In tier one, it's a necessity, but if you're able to ruck run, which is basically you're able to run any flat or downhill surface, and then you walk the uphill surfaces, you're going to be able to crush it.\n\nMy second tip is to be a great teammate and don't be a tool. These are team-oriented events, and I can tell you, in a lot of these selections, you can be peered out. So you don't really want to stand out. And if you do, you want to stand out for the right reason. But basically, be the gray man. Don't spotlight yourself, work with your teammates. This is one of the only times, because in tier one you don't get this, in tier two selections, you'll be working with you can do with your teammates and you get to rely on them while everybody your life is miserable. You can work together, you can bond to get through the suck, all right? So don't alienate your teammates. Be reliable, always be on time, be with your right equipment. Try to be at least five minutes early to every event. And you want to help your teammates without making a show of it. They don't want superstars, they want great teammates. Almost all tier two selection and organizations are all designed around teams and how you help within the team. It isn't until you get to the higher tiers that you start working in such smaller teams or almost individual missions. And that's why this is so much more important in tier two is the team aspect. I've literally seen people who are amazing, probably one of the best people in selection, literally get kicked out because they were primadonnas. So don't do that.\n\nNever be the drama, don't complain ever, don't gossip or argue, don't brag, and don't make excuses.\n\nSo tip number three is never quit. Embrace the misery. This is going to suck. It's designed to suck, all right? So when you're going through training, don't avoid the misery and training, embrace it. Trust me, it will help you.\n\nYou want to stay positive, no matter what. If you screw up, you fall, something happens, stay positive. It's all about how you get through things. The most people that pass, they're not necessarily the fastest. They're the ones who kept going. You have to be able to master your self talk. And you also need to know why you're here. If you showed up and you came for anybody but yourself, you're already losing. And when it at 3:00 in the morning, you're wet, you're tired, you are in the middle of nowhere, you don't even know where you are. That's when your mind is like starting to turn on you. And you have to have the self and the mental discipline to turn it, stay positive. Don't, don't ever quit, right? Everything is one step at a time. Take every event as just that event. Don't worry about the event afterwards, don't worry about the next day, all right? And I know this is the title of a book, but it's one of my favorite, The only easy day was yesterday. Because remember, this is you are going to go through pain. You're going to go through difficulties. And remember, this is just a moment in time. You will get through it. And this difficulty will turn you and make you into the better person, the person that you've always wanted to be. This is a great opportunity and an amazing experience that you should take full advantage of and embrace the suck. So when you get down to it and everything is really, really sucking, just remember, it's just take one step at a time and I promise you, you will get there. If you never say the words I quit, you're going to make it through. I promise.\n\nI hope that was informative. Uh if you guys have any questions, um, feel free to leave comments. I try to respond to every comment that you guys leave. And uh within the next day couple days, I'm going to release part three, which is once again how the differences of how tier one selections differ and how to my best advice for passing a tier one selection. Hope you guys enjoyed this video. I will talk to you guys later.",
