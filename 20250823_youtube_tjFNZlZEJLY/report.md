## Executive Summary

A former Tier 1 special forces operator and selection instructor provides three key tips for passing Tier 2 selection processes (e.g., SEALs, Green Berets, Rangers). The advice emphasizes: 1) developing functional fitness, specifically the ability to ruck and lift heavy weights, not just run; 2) being an exceptional, low-profile teammate in a team-centric environment where peer reviews matter; and 3) cultivating unwavering mental resilience to 'embrace the suck' and never quit, focusing on one event at a time with a strong personal motivation.
