# Product Positioning Document
**ClipScribe v3.0.0 - Web Presence Strategy**  
**Date:** November 13, 2025  
**Purpose:** Define product offering, pricing, and value propositions

---

## One-Sentence Description

**ClipScribe extracts structured intelligence from videos through open-source tools or managed service - replace 10 hours of manual analysis with 10 minutes of AI processing.**

---

## The Problem We Solve

**Current State (Painful):**
1. Analyzing video content manually takes 5-10 hours per video
2. Hiring analysts costs $500-2000 per video
3. Transcription alone isn't enough (no entities, relationships, insights)
4. Existing tools are either too expensive or too limited
5. No good options for one-time processing (everything is subscription)

**What People Try Now:**
- **Manual watching + note-taking:** 10 hours of work, inconsistent quality
- **Transcription services ($15-90/hour):** Just text, no intelligence
- **Meeting tools ($10-40/user/month):** Only for meetings, subscription lock-in
- **Video APIs ($2-5/hour):** Developer-only, no finished outputs
- **Hiring analysts ($50-200/hour):** Expensive, slow, doesn't scale

---

## Our Solution

**ClipScribe delivers finished intelligence from any video:**

1. **Upload video** (or run CLI with your own API keys)
2. **Get structured intelligence** (entities, relationships, topics, sentiment, key moments)
3. **Multiple formats** (JSON for developers, DOCX for reports, CSV for analysis, PPTX for executives, Markdown for docs)
4. **Fast turnaround** (24-72 hours for service, instant for self-hosted)
5. **Honest pricing** ($0 self-hosted, $25-500 managed service)

---

## Pricing Philosophy

### Why We Price This Way

**1. Free Tier is REALLY Free**
- Not a trial, not crippled, not bait-and-switch
- MIT license = use commercially, fork, modify
- Build community and trust
- 90%+ of users will stay free (that's fine!)

**2. Paid Tiers Add Real Value**
- Convenience (no setup, no API keys)
- Speed (we handle processing)
- Support (email, consultation)
- Service (not just software)

**3. Transparent About Margins**
- Yes, we make 99%+ margin on service
- That's called running a service business
- You're paying for convenience, not just compute
- We're honest about this (builds trust)

**4. No Subscription Lock-In**
- Pay per video, not per month
- Use it when you need it
- No wasted spend on months you don't use

**5. Launch Pricing on Series Tier**
- 5-20 videos (not 3-10)
- Building reputation with generosity
- Will adjust based on demand
- Lock in launch pricing now

### What We Don't Do

**❌ Hidden Fees**
- No setup fees
- No platform fees
- No "processing fees"
- No surprise charges

**❌ Usage Limits After Paying**
- No "fair use" policies
- No throttling
- No artificial limits

**❌ Bait and Switch**
- Free tier stays free
- Open source stays MIT
- Prices won't suddenly 10x

**❌ Vendor Lock-In**
- Can always self-host
- Export all your data
- No proprietary formats

## Go-to-Market Strategy

### Phase 1: Soft Launch (Dec 2025)

**Goal:** Validate demand and pricing

**Approach:**
- Website: Landing + Pricing + Samples
- Processing: Manual (email-based)
- Payment: Stripe payment links
- Target: 5-10 paid customers in Month 1

**Marketing:**
- Hacker News post: "Open source video intelligence extraction"
- Reddit: r/OSINT, r/research, r/datascience
- Twitter/X: Sample outputs, transparent pricing
- GitHub: Full source code, comprehensive docs

### Phase 2: Automation (Jan-Feb 2026)

**Goal:** Remove manual processing bottleneck

**Approach:**
- Upload form on website
- Automated processing queue
- Download portal for results
- Stripe Checkout integration

**Target:** 50-100 customers/month, mostly automated

### Phase 3: Scale (Mar+ 2026)

**Goal:** Grow and optimize

**Approach:**
- API access for enterprise
- Faster turnaround options
- More integrations
- Team expansion (if needed)

---

## Success Metrics

### Month 1 (Dec 2025)
- 5-10 paid customers
- 100+ GitHub stars
- 1000+ website visitors
- Validate pricing

### Month 3 (Feb 2026)
- 50-100 paid customers
- $2,000-5,000 MRR
- 50%+ automation
- 500+ GitHub stars

### Month 6 (May 2026)
- 200-500 paid customers
- $10,000-25,000 MRR
- 90%+ automation
- 1-2 enterprise customers

- $50,000+ MRR
- Fully automated
- 10+ enterprise customers

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Free tier cannibalization
**Mitigation:** 90% staying free is fine (Supabase, PostHog model). 10% converting at high margin is sustainable.

### Risk: Competitors copy us
**Mitigation:** Open source is a moat. Community trust and transparency are hard to copy.

### Risk: API costs spike
**Mitigation:** Billing caps, cost monitoring, can always increase prices or switch providers.

### Risk: Manual processing doesn't scale
**Mitigation:** Phase 2 automation planned. Can hire contractor if needed short-term.

### Risk: Enterprise customers demand too much
**Mitigation:** Clear scope in contracts. Can say no to unprofitable custom work.
