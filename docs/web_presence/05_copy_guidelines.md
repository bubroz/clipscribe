# Copy Guidelines & Sample Messaging
**ClipScribe v3.0.0 Web Presence**  
**Date:** November 13, 2025  
**Purpose:** Define tone of voice and provide production-ready copy

---

## Tone of Voice

### Core Principles

**1. Direct, Not Fluffy**
- Say what it does in plain language
- No marketing jargon or buzzwords
- Get to the point quickly

**Examples:**
- ❌ "Unlock the hidden insights within your video content"
- ✅ "Extract entities, relationships, and topics from videos"

- ❌ "Leverage AI-powered intelligent video understanding"
- ✅ "Turn videos into structured intelligence"

**2. Honest, Not Cagey**
- Show exact costs and margins
- Admit limitations
- No bait-and-switch

**Examples:**
- ❌ "Competitive pricing" (vague)
- ✅ "We charge $25 for processing that costs us $0.05"

- ❌ "Industry-leading accuracy" (unverifiable)
- ✅ "Powered by Grok - every entity includes evidence quotes"

**3. Confident, Not Arrogant**
- We know it works, but we're not cocky
- Show results, don't brag
- Let samples speak for themselves

**Examples:**
- ❌ "The world's best video intelligence platform"
- ✅ "Open source intelligence extraction that works"

- ❌ "Revolutionary AI transforms video understanding"
- ✅ "Replace 10 hours of manual analysis with 10 minutes"

**4. Technical, Not Dumbed Down**
- Our audience is smart
- Use correct terminology
- Explain, don't condescend

**Examples:**
- ❌ "Magic AI understands your videos"
- ✅ "WhisperX large-v3 for transcription, Grok for intelligence extraction"

- ❌ "Automatically finds the important stuff"
- ✅ "Extracts entities, relationships, topics, and key moments"

**5. Practical, Not Visionary**
- Solve today's problems, not tomorrow's dreams
- Real use cases, not hypotheticals
- ROI over vision

**Examples:**
- ❌ "Revolutionizing how humanity understands video"
- ✅ "Replacing $500-2000 analyst work with $25 automation"

- ❌ "The future of video intelligence"
- ✅ "Video intelligence extraction that works today"

#### Pricing Philosophy Section

**Headline:**
"Why We Price This Way"

**1. Free Tier is Really Free**

MIT licensed means you can use ClipScribe commercially, fork it, modify it, or integrate it - forever and for free. We're not pulling a bait-and-switch. 90%+ of companies will use the self-hosted version and never pay us. That's fine - we built this to be useful, not to trap you.

**2. Paid Tiers Add Real Value**

When you pay $25-500, you're not paying for software (that's free). You're paying for:
- Convenience (no setup, no API keys, no command line)
- Speed (24-72 hour professional turnaround)
- Support (email assistance, consultation for enterprise)
- Service (we handle everything, you get results)

**3. Transparent About Margins**

Let's be honest: Processing a video costs us $0.003-0.06. We charge $25-500. That's a 99%+ margin.

Is that unfair? No - that's running a service business. You're paying for:
- Our expertise (building and maintaining the system)
- Our time (processing, support, delivery)
- Our infrastructure (reliable, secure processing)
- Our guarantee (refund if you're unhappy)

Compare to hiring an analyst at $50-200/hour who would take 5-10 hours ($500-2000). We're still 95%+ cheaper.

**4. No Subscription Lock-In**

Pay per video, only when you need it. No monthly fees, no wasted spend on months you don't use service. Process 1 video this month and 10 next month? Fine. Skip six months? Also fine.

This is honest pricing for real use cases.

#### FAQ Answers

**Q: How does the free tier work?**

Download the open-source CLI from GitHub (MIT license). You'll need Python 3.12+ and API keys for Grok (~$20/month) and Gemini (free tier available or ~$0.003/video). Follow our documentation to set up and run. No time limits, no feature restrictions, use it commercially - it's truly free.

**Q: What video formats are supported?**

Any format supported by yt-dlp (1800+ platforms including YouTube, Vimeo, TikTok, Twitter/X, and more) or direct MP4/MP3/WebM/MOV uploads. For managed service, send us a link or upload the file.

**Q: What's the turnaround time?**

- Self-hosted: Instant (as fast as your machine processes)
- Single video service: 24-48 hours
- Series analysis: 48-72 hours
- Enterprise: 4-24 hours based on SLA

**Q: Can I get a refund?**

Yes, 100% refund if you're unhappy with output quality or we miss our turnaround commitment. Just email trials@clipscribe.ai within 7 days of delivery. No questions asked.

**Q: Do you offer discounts?**

Yes, we offer discounts for:
- Non-profit organizations (20-30% off)
- Academic researchers and students (20-30% off)
- Journalism organizations (20-30% off)
- High volume (custom enterprise pricing)

Email trials@clipscribe.ai with details about your organization or use case.

**Q: How accurate is the extraction?**

Intelligence extraction is powered by Grok (xAI's LLM). Every entity and relationship includes evidence quotes from the transcript, so you can verify accuracy. We've processed hundreds of videos with consistent quality. That said, AI can make mistakes - always verify important findings.

**Q: Can I see examples before buying?**

Absolutely. Check our [Samples page](/samples) for real outputs in all formats (DOCX, CSV, PPTX, Markdown, JSON) from 3 different video types. Download and inspect before deciding - we have nothing to hide.

**Q: What happens to my video after processing?**

For paid service: We process your video and delete all files (video, audio, intermediate data) within 7 days of delivery. We never use your content for training or any other purpose. See our [Privacy Policy](/privacy) for details.

For self-hosted: Your data never touches our servers. You control everything.

**Q: Why is launch pricing limited?**

We're being extra generous (5-20 videos vs competitors' 3-5) while building our reputation and case studies. As we scale and prove demand, we may adjust pricing or limits. Lock in current rates by processing during launch period.

**Q: Do you have an API?**

Currently, enterprise customers get API access to our managed service. Free tier users have full CLI access. API access for all paid tiers is on our roadmap for Q1 2026.
