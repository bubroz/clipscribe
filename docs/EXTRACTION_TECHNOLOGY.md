ClipScribe's intelligence extraction is a hybrid system that leverages the best of local and cloud-based models. The core of our high-quality, cost-effective extraction is **Google's Gemini 2.5 model family**.

- **Gemini 2.5 Flash**: Used for the majority of high-volume tasks, including transcription and standard entity/relationship extraction. It provides an optimal balance of speed, cost, and capability.
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro**: Reserved for complex, high-reasoning tasks such as multi-video collection synthesis, advanced temporal analysis, and knowledge graph cleaning.

We exclusively use the 2.5 generation models to ensure we are always leveraging the latest technology. We do not use older models like 1.5.
