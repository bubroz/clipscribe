# ClipScribe Comprehensive Validation Checklist

*Last Updated: June 28, 2025*
*Status: DRAFT - Ready for systematic validation*

## Overview

This checklist ensures every claimed ClipScribe feature and workflow actually works as intended. **No feature should be marked "complete" without passing all relevant validation steps.**

## 🎯 Validation Philosophy

1. **Test with real data** - Use actual videos, not synthetic examples
2. **Test edge cases** - Empty inputs, large files, network failures
3. **Test user workflows** - End-to-end scenarios a real user would follow
4. **Test across platforms** - YouTube, Twitter/X, TikTok, generic URLs
5. **Document failures** - Track what doesn't work and why
