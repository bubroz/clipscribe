## File Formats

### transcript.txt
A simple plain text file containing the full transcript. Ideal for quick reading or ingestion into other systems.

### transcript.json
The most comprehensive single-file output. It's a structured JSON file containing:
- The full transcript with word-level or sentence-level segments.
- Complete video metadata (title, URL, duration, etc.).
- All analysis results: summary, key points, topics, entities, and relationships.
- Detailed processing information, including cost, time, and models used.

### metadata.json
A lightweight JSON file providing high-level information at a glance:
- Basic video info (title, channel, duration).
- Core processing details (cost, time).
- Key statistics (word count, entity count, relationship count).

## Core Output Files

### entities.json

## Converting Existing Outputs

If you need to generate the latest output formats from older processing runs, you can use the scripts in the `scripts/` directory. For example, to create a `chimera_format.json` file:

```bash
poetry run python scripts/convert_to_chimera.py output/YYYYMMDD_platform_videoId
```
