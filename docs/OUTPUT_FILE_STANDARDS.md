# ClipScribe Output File Standards

*Last Updated: August 11, 2025*
*Version: v2.29.7*

## Overview

This document establishes quality standards for ClipScribe output files based on comprehensive validation of professional military intelligence content. These standards ensure consistent, high-quality extraction across all video types.

##  Quality Benchmarks (Based on Military Series Validation)

### Baseline Performance Standards
- **Key Points**: 25-35 per video (intelligence briefing style)
- **Entities**: 25-50 per video depending on content density
- **Relationships**: 60-90 per video with evidence chains
- **Processing Cost**: $0.015-0.030 per video (varies by length)
- **Processing Time**: 2-4 minutes per video

### Validated Against: 3-Video Military Training Series
- **Total**: 92 key points, 113 entities, 236 relationships
- **Cost**: $0.0611 total ($0.0203 average per video)
- **Quality**: Professional intelligence analyst standards

##  Key Points Standards

###  **EXCELLENT Quality Indicators**
- **Professional intelligence briefing style**
- **Specific, actionable information** (not generic summaries)
- **Direct quotes of critical facts**
- **Strategic and tactical details included**

#### Examples of EXCELLENT Key Points:
```
 "The main three operational Tier 1 units discussed are SEAL Team Six, Delta Force, and the Intelligence Support Activity."
 "Tier two selections are characterized by negative reinforcement and team-oriented events."
 "The right fitness involves familiarity with water, as many selections include water events."
```

###  **POOR Quality Indicators**
- Generic summaries without specifics
- Repetitive information
- Vague statements without context

#### Examples of POOR Key Points:
```
 "The video discusses military topics."
 "Various things are mentioned."
 "Selection processes are different."
```

### Required Format:
```json
{
  "text": "Specific, actionable insight - intelligence briefing style",
  "importance": 0.9,
  "context": null
}
```

##  PERSON Entity Standards

###  **EXCELLENT Quality Indicators**
- **Specific military roles and backgrounds**
- **Professional descriptors beyond generic titles**
- **Experience and qualification descriptors**

#### Examples of EXCELLENT PERSON Entities:
```
 "Former Special Forces operator"
 "Tier one instructor"  
 "Selection cadre"
 "Combat veteran"
 "MARSOC Raiders (personnel)"
 "Forward Air Controllers"
```

###  **POOR Quality Indicators**
- Only generic "Speaker" entities
- No role-specific extraction
- Missing military background descriptors

#### Examples of POOR PERSON Entities:
```
 "Speaker" (only entity extracted)
 "Person"
 "Individual"
```

##  ORGANIZATION Entity Standards

###  **EXCELLENT Quality Indicators**
- **Military units correctly classified as ORGANIZATION**
- **Full unit names with proper designation**
- **Sub-units and specialized divisions identified**

#### Examples of EXCELLENT ORGANIZATION Entities:
```
 "1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta (Delta Force)"
 "Naval Special Warfare Development Group (DEVGRU)"
 "Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC)"
 "Black Side SEALs" (sub-unit correctly classified)
 "Marine Force Recon"
```

###  **POOR Quality Indicators**
- Military units classified as PRODUCT
- Generic organization names without specificity
- Missing specialized sub-units

#### Examples of POOR ORGANIZATION Classification:
```
 "SEAL Team Six" classified as PRODUCT (should be ORGANIZATION)
 "Military" (too generic)
 "Unit" (too vague)
```

##  Relationship Standards

###  **EXCELLENT Quality Indicators**
- **Specific, meaningful predicates** (not generic "related_to")
- **Clear subject-predicate-object structure**
- **Evidence chains with supporting quotes**

#### Examples of EXCELLENT Relationships:
```
 "Former Special Forces operator" → "is_role_of" → "Speaker"
 "Speaker" → "served_as_cadre_for" → "Tier one selection"  
 "Tier 1 units" → "modeled_after" → "British SAS"
```

###  **POOR Quality Indicators**
- Generic predicates like "related_to", "associated_with"
- Unclear or ambiguous relationships
- No supporting evidence

#### Examples of POOR Relationships:
```
 "Speaker" → "related_to" → "Military"
 "Video" → "discusses" → "Topics"
 "Things" → "connected_to" → "Other things"
```

##  File Structure Standards
