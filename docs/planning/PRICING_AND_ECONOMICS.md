## Why Higher Pricing Works

### 1. **Value-Based, Not Cost-Based**

**Don't price based on your costs ($0.003/min).**
**Price based on value delivered ($107 time savings).**

At $0.10/minute for 30-min video:
- Customer pays: $3.00
- Customer saves: $107 in time (1.75 hours × $60/hour)
- Customer value: 35:1 ROI
- **They'd be stupid NOT to pay $3**

### 2. **Bundle Premium**

**Customers aren't buying "transcription."**
**They're buying:**
- Time savings (hours → minutes)
- Intelligence extraction (automatic)
- Clip generation (ready to share)
- Speaker insights (who said what)

**This is worth more than $0.02/minute commodity transcription.**

### 3. **Competitive Positioning**

**You're not competing with Deepgram ($0.004/min).**
**You're competing with:**
- Descript + Opus Clip combined = $53/month
- Professional video editor = $60/hour
- Manual clip creation = 30 min/clip

**At $0.10/min, you're a STEAL.**

## Pricing Confidence Levels

### Conservative (Safe)
```
Standard: $0.08/minute
Premium: $0.15/minute
Risk: Low (clearly cheaper than alternatives)
Margin: 95%+ (very healthy)
```

### Recommended (Value-Based)
```
Standard: $0.10/minute
Premium: $0.20/minute
Risk: Medium (but justified by features)
Margin: 94-97% (excellent)
```

### Aggressive (Premium)
```
Standard: $0.15/minute
Premium: $0.30/minute
Risk: Higher (need to prove value)
Margin: 95-98% (maximum)
```

**My recommendation: Start at $0.10/min, can always increase.**

Easier to raise prices later than lower them.

---

## Feature-Based Pricing Tiers (Alternative Model)

**If you want to offer different feature sets:**

### Basic: $0.05/minute
```
Features:
- Transcription only (Voxtral)
- Basic speaker labels (SPEAKER_00)
- No clips, no entities
Margin: 94%
Target: Budget-conscious, transcript-only users
```

### Standard: $0.10/minute (Recommended Default)
```
Features: EVERYTHING
- Transcript + speakers + entities + clips
- This is your main offering
Margin: 97%
Target: 90% of customers
```

### Premium: $0.20/minute
```
Features: Everything + WhisperX accuracy
- 99% accuracy for medical/legal
Margin: 70%
Target: 10% of customers (high-stakes content)
```

**My recommendation: Skip "Basic" tier. Everyone gets full features.**

Simpler positioning: "We're the full-featured tool, not a commodity transcription service."

```

### Break-Even Targets

**At $0.10/minute pricing:**
```
Break-even: $50/month costs
Need: 500 minutes/month revenue
= 500 minutes × $0.10 = $50

Can achieve with:
- 2 Starter subscribers ($39 × 2 = $78) ✓
- OR 10 pay-as-you-go users (50 min each)
- OR 1 Professional subscriber ($149)
```

**Extremely low break-even point = low risk**
