## Executive Summary

A former Tier 1 operator and selection cadre provides an analysis of the selection process for elite units like SEAL Team 6, Delta Force, and the Intelligence Support Activity. The core distinction of Tier 1 selection is its focus on psychological assessment through individual events with unknown standards and no feedback. This method tests an operator's mental independence, problem-solving abilities, and decisiveness under pressure. Critical skills for success are exceptional ruck-running, expert land navigation in difficult terrain, and the mental fortitude to handle ambiguous, high-stress, and no-win scenarios independently.
