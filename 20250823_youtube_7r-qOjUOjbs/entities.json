    "Tier 1 selections are primarily individual events designed to test mental independence, with no positive or negative reinforcement and unknown evaluation criteria.",
    "The three key skills required to pass Tier 1 selection are elite-level ruck running, expert land navigation through terrain association, and mental preparedness for independent problem-solving in no-win scenarios.",
    "The three main U.S. operational Tier 1 units discussed are SEAL Team 6, Delta Force, and the Intelligence Support Activity, all of which were modeled after the British SAS.",
    "Tier 1 selections assess an operator's capacity to lead or conduct solo missions without guidance, focusing on mental agility and problem-solving over raw physical endurance which is already proven in Tier 2.",
    "In no-win situations presented during selection, making a decisive choice and committing to it is the critical evaluated trait, not the outcome of the decision itself."
