# 🧠 Portable AI Assistant Brain Templates

**Transform any project into a professional, AI-optimized development environment in minutes!**

## 🎯 What Is This?

This is a **complete, portable AI assistant brain** - a comprehensive collection of reusable rule templates that can be dropped into ANY project to instantly provide:

- 🎯 **Professional Development Standards**
- 📋 **Quality Assurance Protocols**  
- 📚 **Communication Templates**

These templates create a complete "AI assistant brain" for your project - a set of rules that train AI assistants to work exactly how you want them to. Think of it as giving your AI assistant a PhD in your specific project.

## 🚀 Why This Is Revolutionary

### The Problem
Every new project starts from scratch:
- ❌ No consistent standards
- ❌ No quality protocols  
- ❌ No communication templates
- ❌ Reinventing the wheel every time

### The Solution: Portable AI Brain
✅ **Drop-in templates** for instant project governance  
✅ **Consistent quality** across all projects  
✅ **Professional standards** from day one  
✅ **Scalable architecture** from simple to enterprise  
✅ **Cost-effective development** with proven patterns  

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Copy Templates to Your Project
```bash
# In your project root
mkdir -p .cursor/rules
cp cursor_rule_templates/*.mdc .cursor/rules/
```

### Step 2: Customize the Core Identity
Edit `.cursor/rules/core-identity.mdc`:
```yaml
# Replace these placeholders:
PROJECT_NAME → "MyAwesomeApp"
PROJECT_TYPE → "Web Application" (or CLI Tool, Library, etc.)
PRIMARY_LANGUAGE → "Python" (or JavaScript, TypeScript, etc.)
MAIN_FRAMEWORK → "FastAPI" (or React, Vue, Django, etc.)
```

### Step 3: Configure for Your Stack
Edit `.cursor/rules/api-patterns.mdc` if you use APIs:
```yaml
# Replace:
API_TYPE → "REST" (or GraphQL, WebSocket, etc.)
AUTH_METHOD → "JWT" (or OAuth, API Keys, etc.)
```

### Step 4: Set Documentation Style  
Edit `.cursor/rules/documentation-standards.mdc`:
```yaml
# Choose your project type section and delete others:
- Keep "Web Application" section, delete "CLI Tool", "Library", etc.
```

**🎉 Done! Your AI assistant now has a complete brain for your project.**

**Key placeholders to replace:**

| Placeholder | Example | Your Value |
|-------------|---------|------------|
| `PROJECT_NAME` | "ClipScribe" | "YourAppName" |
| `PROJECT_TYPE` | "CLI Tool" | "Web App", "Mobile App", "Library" |
| `PRIMARY_LANGUAGE` | "Python 3.11+" | "JavaScript", "TypeScript", "Go" |
| `MAIN_FRAMEWORK` | "Click" | "React", "FastAPI", "Express" |
| `PRIMARY_STACK` | "Poetry, Gemini" | "npm, AWS", "Docker, Postgres" |

**Example customization for a React app:**
```yaml
## Mission
Build beautiful, responsive web applications with modern React patterns.

## Primary Stack
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.0+
- **Framework**: React 18 with Next.js 14
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui
- **State**: Zustand for client state, React Query for server state
- **Build**: Vite with ESLint and Prettier
```

### 2. API Patterns Template (`api-patterns.mdc`)

**What it does:** Defines how your project handles external APIs and services.

**Key sections to customize:**

```yaml
# Choose your API style (delete others):
- REST APIs → Keep REST section
- GraphQL → Keep GraphQL section  
- WebSocket → Keep WebSocket section

# Configure authentication:
AUTH_METHOD: "JWT" # or "OAuth", "API Keys", "Basic Auth"

# Set rate limiting:
RATE_LIMIT_STRATEGY: "Token bucket" # or "Fixed window", "Sliding window"
```

### 3. Documentation Standards Template (`documentation-standards.mdc`)

**What it does:** Sets up professional documentation structure for your project type.

**Choose your project type (delete others):**

```yaml
# For Web Applications - keep this section:
├── docs/
│   ├── API_REFERENCE.md
│   ├── DEPLOYMENT.md
│   └── USER_GUIDE.md

# For CLI Tools - keep this section:  
├── docs/
│   ├── CLI_REFERENCE.md
│   ├── INSTALLATION.md
│   └── TROUBLESHOOTING.md

# For Libraries - keep this section:
├── docs/
│   ├── API_DOCUMENTATION.md
│   ├── EXAMPLES.md
│   └── CHANGELOG.md
```

### 4. Testing Standards Template (`testing-standards.mdc`)

**What it does:** Sets up comprehensive testing practices for your stack.

**Customize for your framework:**

```yaml
# For React projects:
TESTING_FRAMEWORK: "Jest + React Testing Library"
E2E_FRAMEWORK: "Playwright" # or "Cypress"

# For Python projects:
TESTING_FRAMEWORK: "pytest"
E2E_FRAMEWORK: "pytest + requests" # or "Selenium"

# For Node.js projects:
TESTING_FRAMEWORK: "Jest + Supertest"
E2E_FRAMEWORK: "Playwright" # or "Cypress"
```

### 5. Master Governance Template (`README.mdc`)

**What it does:** Controls all other rules and sets task completion standards.

**Usually needs minimal customization, but you can:**

```yaml
# Adjust communication style:
COMMUNICATION_STYLE: "comprehensive" # or "concise", "technical"

# Set documentation requirements:
REQUIRED_DOCS: ["README", "CHANGELOG", "API_DOCS"]

## 🎯 Quick Customization Checklist

**For any new project, update these 5 things:**

- [ ] **Project name** in `core-identity.mdc`
- [ ] **Primary language/framework** in `core-identity.mdc`  
- [ ] **Choose project type section** in `documentation-standards.mdc`
- [ ] **API patterns** (if applicable) in `api-patterns.mdc`
- [ ] **Testing framework** in `testing-standards.mdc`

**That's it! Everything else works out of the box.**

## 🚨 Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Don't skip the core identity** - This is the foundation everything else builds on
2. **Don't keep all project types** - Delete sections that don't apply to you
3. **Don't forget to test** - Run through a few AI assistant interactions to make sure it's working
4. **Don't over-customize initially** - Start simple, add complexity as needed

## 🔍 Testing Your Setup

After customization, test your AI assistant:

1. **Ask for a code review** - Does it follow your standards?
2. **Request documentation** - Does it use your format?
3. **Ask for architecture advice** - Does it suggest your stack?
4. **Request a new feature** - Does it follow your patterns?

If any of these feel off, revisit your rule customizations.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### AI assistant not following rules?
- Check that files are in `.cursor/rules/` directory
- Verify YAML frontmatter is valid
- Make sure you deleted unused project type sections

### Rules conflicting with each other?
- Check the "Rule Precedence" section in `README.mdc`
- More specific rules override general ones
- `alwaysApply: true` rules take priority

### Want to disable a rule temporarily?
```yaml
# Change this:
alwaysApply: true

# To this:
alwaysApply: false
```

### Need help with specific customization?
The templates include extensive comments and examples. Look for `# CUSTOMIZE:` markers throughout the files.
