# Master Rules & Task Completion Guide

This is the central rule that governs all other rules and ensures proper task completion in the ClipScribe project.

## Rule Management

### Rule Format
Each `.mdc` file in `.cursor/rules/` follows this structure:

```yaml
---
description: "Brief description of the rule's purpose"
globs: ["**/*.py", "src/**/*.ts"]  # File patterns for auto-attachment
alwaysApply: false  # Whether the rule always applies
---

# Rule Content
```

### Available Rules
- `README.mdc` (this file) - Master rule for all project governance
- `clipscribe-architecture.mdc` - Core architecture and design patterns
- `video-processing.mdc` - Guidelines for video/audio processing code
- `extractor-patterns.mdc` - Best practices for knowledge extractors
- `testing-standards.mdc` - Testing requirements and patterns
- `cli-command-patterns.mdc` - Patterns and conventions for CLI commands
- `error-handling-logging.mdc` - Consistent error handling and logging
- `api-integration-patterns.mdc` - External API integration patterns
- `configuration-management.mdc` - Settings and configuration guidelines
- `cost-optimization.mdc` - Keeping API costs low (always applies!)
- `async-patterns.mdc` - Best practices for async/await code
- `output-format-management.mdc` - Managing and adding output formats
- `model-data-structures.mdc` - Pydantic models and data validation

### How Rules Work
1. **Auto-attachment**: Rules with matching `globs` patterns automatically apply when working on those files
2. **Always Apply**: Rules with `alwaysApply: true` are active for all interactions
3. **Manual Reference**: You can reference any rule using `@rules/rule-name`

### Creating New Rules
When adding a new rule:
1. Use descriptive kebab-case filenames (e.g., `api-patterns.mdc`)
2. Include proper frontmatter with:
   - `description`: Brief explanation of what the rule covers
   - `globs`: File patterns where rule auto-applies (can be empty `[]`)
   - `alwaysApply`: true/false - whether rule is always active
3. Keep rules focused on a single concern
4. Include practical examples and code snippets
5. Use clear section headers and formatting
6. Add the rule to this README's Available Rules list

### When to Create Rules
Create a new rule when:
- You find yourself explaining the same pattern multiple times
- There's a specific convention unique to this project
- You want to document best practices for a component
- There are gotchas or non-obvious patterns to remember
- You need to ensure consistency across the codebase

### Updating Existing Rules
When modifying rules:
1. Preserve the frontmatter structure
2. Document why the change was made (in commit message)
3. Verify glob patterns still match intended files
4. Check for conflicts with other rules
5. Update any documentation that references the old behavior

## Task Completion Checklist

**CRITICAL: At the completion of EVERY task, ensure the following are updated:**

### 1. Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update relevant files in `docs/` directory:
  - `README.md` - Main project documentation
  - `GETTING_STARTED.md` - For setup/installation changes
  - `CLI_REFERENCE.md` - For command changes
  - `DEVELOPMENT.md` - For development workflow changes
  - `OUTPUT_FORMATS.md` - For output format changes
  - `PLATFORMS.md` - For platform support changes
  - `VISUALIZING_GRAPHS.md` - For visualization changes

### 2. Code Documentation
- [ ] Update docstrings for modified functions/classes
- [ ] Ensure type hints are present and accurate
- [ ] Add inline comments for complex logic

### 3. Rule Updates
- [ ] Check if any `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files need updating:
  - Architecture changes → Update `clipscribe-architecture.mdc`
  - New extractors → Update `extractor-patterns.mdc`
  - Process changes → Update relevant rule files
  - New patterns → Create new rule file if needed

### 4. Version & Changelog
- [ ] Update `CHANGELOG.md` with:
  - Version number
  - Date
  - Clear description of changes
  - Breaking changes clearly marked
- [ ] Update version in `pyproject.toml` if releasing
- [ ] Update version in `src/clipscribe/version.py`

### 5. Continuation Prompt
- [ ] Update `CONTINUATION_PROMPT.md` with:
  - Current project state
  - Recent major changes
  - Known issues or TODOs
  - Next planned features
  - Any context future AI assistants need

### 6. Tests
- [ ] Add/update tests for new functionality
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass
- [ ] Update test documentation if test structure changes

### 7. Dependencies
- [ ] If dependencies added/removed, update:
  - `pyproject.toml`
  - Run `poetry lock` to update `poetry.lock`
  - Update installation docs if needed

### 8. Examples
- [ ] Update example scripts in `examples/` if APIs change
- [ ] Ensure examples still run correctly
- [ ] Add new examples for new features

### 9. Configuration
- [ ] Update `env.example` if new environment variables added
- [ ] Update configuration documentation
- [ ] Ensure backward compatibility or document breaking changes

### 10. Git Commit
- [ ] Use conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`
- [ ] Include comprehensive commit message
- [ ] Reference any related issues

## Rule Precedence

When rules conflict:
1. This master rule (README.mdc) takes highest precedence
2. `alwaysApply: true` rules override others
3. More specific glob patterns override general ones
4. Newer rules override older ones for the same scope

## Best Practices

1. **Consistency**: Follow established patterns unless changing them intentionally
2. **Documentation**: Every change should be documented
3. **Testing**: Every feature should be tested
4. **Communication**: Use clear commit messages and update all relevant docs
5. **Completeness**: Use the task completion checklist for EVERY task

## Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# After making changes, common commands:
poetry run black src/              # Format code
poetry run pytest                  # Run tests
poetry run pytest --cov=clipscribe # Check coverage
poetry check                       # Validate pyproject.toml
```

Remember: This rule is the governance framework for the entire project. When in doubt, refer back to this document and ensure all checklist items are completed.
