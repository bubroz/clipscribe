## 🎯 Quick Decision Guide

Ask yourself after making changes:

1. **Will users notice this change?** → Update README.md
2. **Is this a new feature or bug fix?** → Update CHANGELOG.md
3. **Did I change how commands work?** → Update CLI_REFERENCE.md
4. **Did I leave work unfinished?** → Update CONTINUATION_PROMPT.md
5. **Could someone get confused?** → Update relevant docs/

## 📊 Update Priority Matrix

| Priority | Document | Update Trigger | Impact of Not Updating |
|----|----|----|---|
| CRITICAL | CONTINUATION_PROMPT.md | Any significant change | Lost context |
| HIGH | README.md | User-facing changes | Confused users |
| HIGH | CHANGELOG.md | Any code change | No version tracking |
| MEDIUM | CLI_REFERENCE.md | Command changes | Incorrect usage |
| MEDIUM | docs/*.md | Feature changes | Outdated guides |

## 🚫 Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **"I'll document it later"** → Document as you go
2. **"It's a small change"** → Small changes accumulate
3. **"The code is self-documenting"** → Users don't read code
4. **"I'll remember what I did"** → You won't in 2 weeks
5. **"No one reads docs anyway"** → They do when things break

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Write docs before code** → Clarifies thinking
2. **Update docs with code** → In the same commit
3. **Test examples** → Ensure they actually work
4. **Use templates** → Consistency saves time
5. **Review quarterly** → Catch drift early

Remember: Future you (and other developers) will thank current you for good documentation :-)
