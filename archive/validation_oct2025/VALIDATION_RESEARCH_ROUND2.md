# Validation Dataset Research - Round 2: Benchmarking Standards
**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Goal:** Understand SOTA results, DER methodology, baseline comparisons, metrics reporting

---

## Research Questions

### Critical Questions to Answer:

1. **What are competitive DER scores for each dataset?**
   - CHiME-6 challenge winners: X% DER
   - AMI corpus SOTA: Y% DER
   - What's "good" vs "world-class"?

2. **How is DER actually calculated?**
   - Collar (forgiveness window) settings?
   - Missed speech penalty?
   - False alarm penalty?
   - Speaker confusion penalty?

3. **What WER/CER scores are expected?**
   - Clean audio (AnnoMI): Expected WER?
   - Far-field (CHiME-6): Expected WER?
   - Mandarin (character-based): Expected CER?

4. **How do we report results properly?**
   - Standard format for academic publication?
   - Industry benchmark comparison format?
   - Which metrics matter most?
