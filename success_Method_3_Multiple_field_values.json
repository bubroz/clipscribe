  "text": " About a year ago, my friend Jim Keller hit me up after watching my video on Mouse Utopia. He loved the video and said it got him thinking about a core theory of his that he wanted to run past me. It took him like an hour to explain fully, but he said that so much of modern culture is a form of mate suppression. That was a theory that existed beforehand, but which he articulated in very cogent terms. What that means is that everything in our society is imposing costs on others to lessen their chances of reproductive success, normally carried out by those in power who aren't hurt by those costs in the same way. Jim asked me to pull my audience for how many were aware of the concept of mate suppression. I told him I thought most people in these circles already knew about the concept, and I was horrified that only a small minority of my audience knew what it was. I told Jim then that I'd make a video on the topic, and the video's been stewing in my mind ever since. So, thanks for the idea. As time has passed, it's consistently grown in my mind more. A year ago, I had a sense that a lot of our culture was mate suppression, but as more time passed, in which I perceived the world through those new goggles, I kept finding the rabbit hole went deeper and deeper. This video is the end point of a year of thinking about how literally every single element of our society is built off mate suppression. Things I never even thought about, like the current religion, manners, culture, government, and values, only make sense through the lens of those with power trying to raise the costs of reproduction for everyone else. I hope it horrifies you as much as it did me. These videos take a while to make, which means I spend a lot of time sitting at my desk hard at work, and I need a comfortable place to sit during that time, and Flexus Spot provides the perfect chair. Flexus Spot has it all. Take the C7M, for example, with an adjustable headrest that can tilt in almost any direction. It's perfect for work or relaxing. The lumbar support is designed differently from traditional ones that can only support the lumbar region. By focusing on sacrum support, it automatically supports both the lumbar and the sacrum, making it more ergonomic. Plus, it has adjustable seat depth, armrests, and backrest. The C7M also has a memory foam seat cushion, a footrest, and recliner, making it a perfect office work gaming or just hanging around chair. I've really enjoyed my chair and it's made my work a lot more comfortable. I encourage anyone who spends a lot of time at their desk to get one. Flexus Spot is having a summer sale where if you use the code C750, you can save $50 on a new chair. And this doesn't even include a 10-year warranty on any broken chairs. So click the link below to start using Flexus Bot today. Part 1. What the fuck is the World Economic Forum? I've always been in complete shock that the World Economic Forum actually exists. I'm from Philly, whose elite were old-school wasps, whose ancestors were on the Mayflower 400 years ago, and I just assumed, until after I left Pennsylvania, that that's what all of America's elite were like, much like they were 50 years ago. However, as I spent more time on the coasts, before settling down where I am now in Texas, I realized a completely new elite had taken over the Western world, nearly completely replacing the old wasps, while claiming to be superior to the wasps as their right to rule, while in fact the WEF were vastly more tyrannical in every conceivable way. I've been meaning to make a strategic analysis of the WEF, or World Economic Forum, for the longest time. I ordered a bunch of books by Klaus Schwab I am yet to read, since I find their existence in itself really fascinating as a sort of example for how strange the human condition can get. This is one of the things I frequently think about, where I try to find different people or civilizations, where I look at them and think, how did creation produce you? How were you the natural incentive structure of the world? Because",
