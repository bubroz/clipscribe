What America is supposed to be about is the land of opportunity. If you describe America... Sure, I agree with that. Okay. But what we have now, we have a situation where the top one-tenth of 1% now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90%. So there's a lot that has to be done. And the goal is to create a nation that works for all of us, not just the 1%. Sir, I don't mean to interrupt, but rather than complain about the 1% or the .1%, why not... make the rest of America and put them into the 1%? Well, if you put everybody into the 1%, they wouldn't be the 1%. Well, no, it still would be. No, it wouldn't be. If I can... The rest of the population, by definition, they're not in the 1% if they're the rest of the population. But all of the population is a hundred percent. All right, so this is simple math If you have one percent here the one percent you have 99 Yeah, and if you move the nine in there you have 19 and then you move the other nine there Well, if you believe in equality, why not have a hundred percent of people in the one percent? These are my figures. This is the International Institute of Scientific Truth and Knowledge so This has been proven that this can work. This might lead to some increase in the deficit. But essentially, it is possible. What is your proposal, Billy? That you keep the 1%, but you move the 99% into the 1%. And so you have 199%. You just move over the nines. You have the 99% or in the 1%. Billy, I don't know what you're talking about. I really don't. I need a hospital. I need a clinic. I need a reason not to be a cynic.",
