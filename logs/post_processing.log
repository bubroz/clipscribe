            The human voice. It's the instrument, we all play. It's the most powerful sound in the world. Probably, it's the only one that can start a war or say I love you. And yet many people have the experience that when they speak people, don't listen to them. Why is that? How can we speak powerfully to make change in the world? What I like to suggest there are a number of habits that we need to move away from. I've assembled for your pleasure here, seven deadly, sins of speaking. I'm not pretending, this is an exhaustive list but these seven I think are pretty large. How about that? We can all fall into first. Got it. Speaking ill of somebody who's not present. Not a nice habit and we know perfectly. Well, the person gossiping five minutes later will be gossiping about us. Second judging we know people who are like this in conversation and it's very hard to listen to somebody. If you know that you're being judged and found wanting at the same time for negativity, You can fall into this my mother in the last years of her life became very, very negative and it's hard to listen. I remember one day, I said to her, it's October the first today and she said I know is it Dreadful? It's hard to listen when somebody's that negative. And another form of negativity complaining. Well, this is the National Art of the UK. It's our national sport. We can play in about the weather about sport about politics about everything, but actually complaining is viral misery. It's not spreading sunshine and lightness in the world. Excuses. We've all met this guy. Maybe we've all been this guy. Some people have a blame thrower. They just pass it on to everybody else and don't take responsibility for their actions and again hard to listen to somebody who's being like that. Penultimate the six of the seven, embroidery. Exaggeration. It means our language actually. Sometimes, for example, if I see something that really is awesome, what do I call it? and then of course, this exaggeration becomes lying out and outlying and we don't want to listen to people, we know aligned to us and finally, dogmatism The confusion of facts with opinions. When those two things get conflated, you're listening into the wind, you know, somebody is bombarding you with their opinions as if they were true. It's difficult to listen to that. So here they are seven. Deadly sins of speaking. These are things. I think we need to avoid, but is there a positive way to think about this? Yes, there is. I'd like to suggest that there are four really powerful cornerstones foundations that we can stand on if we want our speech to be powerful and to make change in the world. Fortunately, these things spell a word. The word is hail, and it has a great definition as well. I'm not talking about the stuff that falls from the sky and hits you on the head. I'm talking about this definition to greet or a enthusiastically. Which is, I think how our words will be received if we stand on these four things. So what do they stand for? See if you can guess. The honesty, of course. Being true in what you say being straight and clear. The a is authenticity just being yourself. A friend of mine described it as standing in your own truth, which I think is a lovely way to put it. The eye is integrity. Being your word actually, doing what you say, and being somebody people can trust. And the L is love. I don't mean romantic love. But I do mean wishing people. Well, For two reasons. First of all, I think absolute honesty may not be what we want. I mean my goodness you look ugly this morning perhaps. That's not necessary. Tempered with love, of course, honesty is a great thing. But also, if you're really wishing somebody, well, it's very hard to judge them at the same time. I'm not even sure you can do those two things simultaneously. so, hey, Also. Now that's what you say and it's like the old song. It is what you say, it's all. So the way that you say it, you have an amazing toolbox. This instrument is incredible. And yet this is a toolbox that very few people have ever opened. I'd like to have a little Rummage in there with you now. Just pull a few tools out that you might like to take away with which will increase the power of your speaking. Register. For example, now, full set a register may not be very useful most of the time, but there's a register in between. I'm not going to get very technical about this. For any of you who are Voice coaches, you can look at your voice. However, so if I talk up here in my nose, you can hear the difference. If I go down here in my throat, which is where most of us speak from most of the time. But if you want weight, you need to go down here to the chest. You hear the difference. We vote for politicians, with lower voices. It's true. Because we associate depth with power, and with authority. That's a register. And we have tambe it's the the way your voice feels again. The research shows that we prefer voices, which are rich smooth, warm like hot chocolate well, if that's not you That's not the end of the world because you can train, go get a voice coach. And there are amazing things you can do with breathing with posture, with exercise is to improve the Timbre of your voice. Then prosody I love prosody. This is the Singsong. The metal language that we use in order to impart, meaning its Route, 1 for meaning. In conversation, people who speak all on one note are really quite hard to Listen to If they don't have any prosody at all. That's where the words monotonic comes from, what monotonous monotony. Also, we have repetitive prosle now coming in where every sentence sends. It works question when it's actually not a question, it's a statement and if you repeat that one over and over, it's actually restricting your ability to communicate through, prosody which I think is a shame. So let's try and break that habit. Pace. I can get very, very excited by saying something really, really quickly or I can slow right down to emphasize. And at the end of that, of course, is our old friend silence. It's nothing wrong with a bit of silence, in a talk. Is there? We don't have to fill it with arms and Ours. Can be very powerful. Of course, pitch often goes along with Pace to indicate arousal, but you can do it just with pitch. Where did you leave my keys? Where did you leave my keys? Just slightly different meaning in those two deliveries. And finally volume. I can get really excited. by using volume, sorry about that by startled anybody or I can have you Some people broadcast the whole time. Trying not to do that. That's called casting imposing your sound on people around you. Carelessly and inconsiderate not nice. Of course where this all comes into play. Most of all, is when you've got something really important to do, it might be standing on a stage like this and giving a talk to people. It might be proposing, marriage. Asking for a raise. A wedding speech, whatever it is. If it's really important, you owe it to yourself to look at this toolbox and the engine that it's going to work on and no engine works well without being warmed up. Warmed up your voice. Actually let me show you how to do that. Would you all like to stand up for a moment? I'm going to show you the six vocal warm-up exercises that I do before every talk I ever do. Anytime you are going to talk to anybody, important do these first arms up. Deep breath in and sigh out like that one more time. Very good. Now, we're going to warm up our lips and we're going to go there very good and now Just like when you're a kid now your lips should be coming alive. We're going to do the tongue next with exaggerated la la la la la la beautiful. You're getting really good at this and then roll an R. That's like champagne for the tongue. Finally. And if I can only do one the pros, call this the siren, it's really good. It starts with we and goes to all the we is high, the oil is low. So we go Oh, fantastic. Give yourself a round of applause. Thank you, Steve, thank you. Next time you speak, do those in advance. Now, let me just put this in context to close. This is a serious Point here. This is where we are now, right? We speak not very well into people who simply aren't listening and that's all about noise and bad Acoustics I have talked about that on this stage in different phases. What would the world be like? If we were speaking powerfully to people who are listening consciously, its were actually fit for purpose or to make that a bit larger. What would the world be like if we were creating sound consciously? And consuming sound consciously and designing all our environments consciously for sound. That would be a world that does sound beautiful. And one way understanding. Would be the norm and that is an idea worth spreading. Thank you.

It's the most powerful sound in the world, perhaps the only one that can start a war or say "I love you." Yet, many people experience not being listened to. Why? How can we speak powerfully to effect change?

I suggest we abandon certain habits. I’ve identified seven deadly sins of speaking.  This isn't an exhaustive list, but these seven are significant.  First: speaking ill of someone who's absent.  It's an unpleasant habit, and we know the gossiper will soon gossip about us. 

Second: judging.  It's difficult to listen to someone who's judging you. Third: negativity.  My mother, in her later years, became very negative, making her hard to listen to.  I recall saying to her, "It's October 1st today." She replied, "I know. Dreadful, isn't it?"  

Another form of negativity is complaining.  It's a national pastime. We complain about the weather, sports, politics—everything. Complaining is viral misery; it doesn't spread sunshine.

Fourth: excuses. We've all met, or perhaps been, this person.  Some have a blame thrower, passing responsibility to everyone else.  It's hard to listen to someone like that.

Fifth: exaggeration.  Sometimes, we exaggerate when describing something truly awesome. This exaggeration can escalate into lying, and we don't want to listen to liars.

Sixth: dogmatism—the confusion of facts with opinions.  When these conflate, it’s like listening to the wind. Someone bombards you with opinions as if they were facts. It’s difficult to listen.

Seventh: dogmatism—confusing facts with opinions. When these are conflated, it feels like listening to the wind as someone bombards you with opinions disguised as facts.

So, those are seven deadly sins of speaking to avoid. But is there a positive approach? Yes.  Four powerful cornerstones can make our speech powerful and effective.  Fortunately, these spell a word: HAIL.  I'm not referring to frozen precipitation; I mean to greet enthusiastically.  This is how our words will be received if we embrace these four cornerstones.

H: Honesty. Be truthful and clear.  A: Authenticity. Be yourself. A friend described it as "standing in your own truth." I: Integrity. Be true to your word. Be trustworthy. L: Love.  Not romantic love, but wishing people well.  Absolute honesty, untempered by love, can be brutal.  Also, it’s hard to judge someone while genuinely wishing them well.

How you say something matters.  Your voice is an incredible instrument, a toolbox few people fully utilize. Let’s explore a few tools.

Register:  While a full vocal range isn’t always necessary, speaking from your chest adds weight and conveys power and authority. We associate deeper voices with these qualities.

Timbre:  Research suggests we prefer voices that are rich, smooth, and warm.  If that’s not your natural timbre, you can train with a voice coach. Breathing, posture, and exercises can improve timbre.

Prosody:  This is the singsong, the inflection that imparts meaning. Monotonous speakers are difficult to listen to.  Avoid repetitive upspeak, turning statements into questions.

Pace: Varying your pace can emphasize points.  Silence can also be powerful. Don’t feel compelled to fill every pause with "ums" and "ahs."

Pitch:  Like pace, pitch conveys emotion.  Subtle shifts in pitch can alter meaning.

Volume:  Use volume strategically for emphasis, but avoid broadcasting—imposing your voice on others.

These tools are crucial for important occasions: giving a talk, proposing marriage, asking for a raise, delivering a wedding speech.  Prepare by warming up your voice.  Here are six exercises I do before every talk:  Deep breaths and sighs; lip trills; tongue trills; rolled "r"s; and sirens (sliding from a high "wee" to a low "ooh").

Let's put this in context.  Currently, we speak poorly to those who aren't listening, amidst noise and bad acoustics. What if we spoke powerfully to people listening consciously?  What if we created, consumed, and designed environments consciously for sound? That world would sound beautiful, and understanding would be the norm.  That's an idea worth spreading. Thank you.

2024-11-20 16:27:34,345 - post_processing - DEBUG - Raw Gemini response: Julian Treasure's TED Talk, "How to Speak So That People Want to Listen," explores the power of the human voice and provides practical advice for improving communication. He argues that many people feel unheard due to common speaking habits he labels the "seven deadly sins": gossiping, judging, negativity, excuses, exaggeration, dogmatism, and confusing facts with opinions.  These habits create barriers to effective communication and discourage listening.

To counteract these negative tendencies, Treasure proposes four cornerstones of powerful speaking, summarized by the acronym HAIL: Honesty, Authenticity, Integrity, and Love (wishing others well).  He emphasizes that being truthful, genuine, trustworthy, and compassionate creates a receptive environment for communication.

Beyond content, Treasure highlights the importance of *how* we speak. He encourages listeners to leverage their vocal toolbox, including register, timbre, prosody, pace, pitch, and volume. He suggests specific vocal exercises like deep breaths, lip trills, and tongue trills to warm up the voice before important speaking engagements.

Treasure's overall tone is optimistic and empowering. He envisions a "sonorous world of listening and understanding" where people speak powerfully and consciously create sound-positive environments.  He concludes by challenging the audience to embrace these principles and contribute to a world where effective communication is the norm.  The key stakeholders are anyone who wants to improve their communication skills, from individuals in personal relationships to professionals giving presentations. While the talk doesn't offer specific data points, it provides a practical framework and actionable advice for enhancing communication effectiveness.

            The human voice: the instrument we all play. It's the most powerful sound in the world, perhaps the only one that can start a war or say "I love you." Yet, many people experience not being listened to. Why? How can we speak powerfully to effect change?

I suggest we abandon certain habits. I’ve identified seven deadly sins of speaking.  This isn't an exhaustive list, but these seven are significant.  First: speaking ill of someone who's absent.  It's an unpleasant habit, and we know the gossiper will soon gossip about us. 

Second: judging.  It's difficult to listen to someone who's judging you. Third: negativity.  My mother, in her later years, became very negative, making her hard to listen to.  I recall saying to her, "It's October 1st today." She replied, "I know. Dreadful, isn't it?"  

Another form of negativity is complaining.  It's a national pastime. We complain about the weather, sports, politics—everything. Complaining is viral misery; it doesn't spread sunshine.

Fourth: excuses. We've all met, or perhaps been, this person.  Some have a blame thrower, passing responsibility to everyone else.  It's hard to listen to someone like that.

Fifth: exaggeration.  Sometimes, we exaggerate when describing something truly awesome. This exaggeration can escalate into lying, and we don't want to listen to liars.

Sixth: dogmatism—the confusion of facts with opinions.  When these conflate, it’s like listening to the wind. Someone bombards you with opinions as if they were facts. It’s difficult to listen.

Seventh: dogmatism—confusing facts with opinions. When these are conflated, it feels like listening to the wind as someone bombards you with opinions disguised as facts.

So, those are seven deadly sins of speaking to avoid. But is there a positive approach? Yes.  Four powerful cornerstones can make our speech powerful and effective.  Fortunately, these spell a word: HAIL.  I'm not referring to frozen precipitation; I mean to greet enthusiastically.  This is how our words will be received if we embrace these four cornerstones.

H: Honesty. Be truthful and clear.  A: Authenticity. Be yourself. A friend described it as "standing in your own truth." I: Integrity. Be true to your word. Be trustworthy. L: Love.  Not romantic love, but wishing people well.  Absolute honesty, untempered by love, can be brutal.  Also, it’s hard to judge someone while genuinely wishing them well.

How you say something matters.  Your voice is an incredible instrument, a toolbox few people fully utilize. Let’s explore a few tools.

Register:  While a full vocal range isn’t always necessary, speaking from your chest adds weight and conveys power and authority. We associate deeper voices with these qualities.

Timbre:  Research suggests we prefer voices that are rich, smooth, and warm.  If that’s not your natural timbre, you can train with a voice coach. Breathing, posture, and exercises can improve timbre.

Prosody:  This is the singsong, the inflection that imparts meaning. Monotonous speakers are difficult to listen to.  Avoid repetitive upspeak, turning statements into questions.

Pace: Varying your pace can emphasize points.  Silence can also be powerful. Don’t feel compelled to fill every pause with "ums" and "ahs."

Pitch:  Like pace, pitch conveys emotion.  Subtle shifts in pitch can alter meaning.

Volume:  Use volume strategically for emphasis, but avoid broadcasting—imposing your voice on others.

These tools are crucial for important occasions: giving a talk, proposing marriage, asking for a raise, delivering a wedding speech.  Prepare by warming up your voice.  Here are six exercises I do before every talk:  Deep breaths and sighs; lip trills; tongue trills; rolled "r"s; and sirens (sliding from a high "wee" to a low "ooh").

Let's put this in context.  Currently, we speak poorly to those who aren't listening, amidst noise and bad acoustics. What if we spoke powerfully to people listening consciously?  What if we created, consumed, and designed environments consciously for sound? That world would sound beautiful, and understanding would be the norm.  That's an idea worth spreading. Thank you.

            Text: The human voice: the instrument we all play. It's the most powerful sound in the world, perhaps the only one that can start a war or say "I love you." Yet, many people experience not being listened to. Why? How can we speak powerfully to effect change?

I suggest we abandon certain habits. I’ve identified seven deadly sins of speaking.  This isn't an exhaustive list, but these seven are significant.  First: speaking ill of someone who's absent.  It's an unpleasant habit, and we know the gossiper will soon gossip about us. 

Second: judging.  It's difficult to listen to someone who's judging you. Third: negativity.  My mother, in her later years, became very negative, making her hard to listen to.  I recall saying to her, "It's October 1st today." She replied, "I know. Dreadful, isn't it?"  

Another form of negativity is complaining.  It's a national pastime. We complain about the weather, sports, politics—everything. Complaining is viral misery; it doesn't spread sunshine.

Fourth: excuses. We've all met, or perhaps been, this person.  Some have a blame thrower, passing responsibility to everyone else.  It's hard to listen to someone like that.

Fifth: exaggeration.  Sometimes, we exaggerate when describing something truly awesome. This exaggeration can escalate into lying, and we don't want to listen to liars.

Sixth: dogmatism—the confusion of facts with opinions.  When these conflate, it’s like listening to the wind. Someone bombards you with opinions as if they were facts. It’s difficult to listen.

Seventh: dogmatism—confusing facts with opinions. When these are conflated, it feels like listening to the wind as someone bombards you with opinions disguised as facts.

So, those are seven deadly sins of speaking to avoid. But is there a positive approach? Yes.  Four powerful cornerstones can make our speech powerful and effective.  Fortunately, these spell a word: HAIL.  I'm not referring to frozen precipitation; I mean to greet enthusiastically.  This is how our words will be received if we embrace these four cornerstones.

H: Honesty. Be truthful and clear.  A: Authenticity. Be yourself. A friend described it as "standing in your own truth." I: Integrity. Be true to your word. Be trustworthy. L: Love.  Not romantic love, but wishing people well.  Absolute honesty, untempered by love, can be brutal.  Also, it’s hard to judge someone while genuinely wishing them well.

How you say something matters.  Your voice is an incredible instrument, a toolbox few people fully utilize. Let’s explore a few tools.

Register:  While a full vocal range isn’t always necessary, speaking from your chest adds weight and conveys power and authority. We associate deeper voices with these qualities.

Timbre:  Research suggests we prefer voices that are rich, smooth, and warm.  If that’s not your natural timbre, you can train with a voice coach. Breathing, posture, and exercises can improve timbre.

Prosody:  This is the singsong, the inflection that imparts meaning. Monotonous speakers are difficult to listen to.  Avoid repetitive upspeak, turning statements into questions.

Pace: Varying your pace can emphasize points.  Silence can also be powerful. Don’t feel compelled to fill every pause with "ums" and "ahs."

Pitch:  Like pace, pitch conveys emotion.  Subtle shifts in pitch can alter meaning.

Volume:  Use volume strategically for emphasis, but avoid broadcasting—imposing your voice on others.

These tools are crucial for important occasions: giving a talk, proposing marriage, asking for a raise, delivering a wedding speech.  Prepare by warming up your voice.  Here are six exercises I do before every talk:  Deep breaths and sighs; lip trills; tongue trills; rolled "r"s; and sirens (sliding from a high "wee" to a low "ooh").

Let's put this in context.  Currently, we speak poorly to those who aren't listening, amidst noise and bad acoustics. What if we spoke powerfully to people listening consciously?  What if we created, consumed, and designed environments consciously for sound? That world would sound beautiful, and understanding would be the norm.  That's an idea worth spreading. Thank you.

            Transcript:
            The human voice. It's the instrument, we all play. It's the most powerful sound in the world. Probably, it's the only one that can start a war or say I love you. And yet many people have the experience that when they speak people, don't listen to them. Why is that? How can we speak powerfully to make change in the world? What I like to suggest there are a number of habits that we need to move away from. I've assembled for your pleasure here, seven deadly, sins of speaking. I'm not pretending, this is an exhaustive list but these seven I think are pretty large. How about that? We can all fall into first. Got it. Speaking ill of somebody who's not present. Not a nice habit and we know perfectly. Well, the person gossiping five minutes later will be gossiping about us. Second judging we know people who are like this in conversation and it's very hard to listen to somebody. If you know that you're being judged and found wanting at the same time for negativity, You can fall into this my mother in the last years of her life became very, very negative and it's hard to listen. I remember one day, I said to her, it's October the first today and she said I know is it Dreadful? It's hard to listen when somebody's that negative. And another form of negativity complaining. Well, this is the National Art of the UK. It's our national sport. We can play in about the weather about sport about politics about everything, but actually complaining is viral misery. It's not spreading sunshine and lightness in the world. Excuses. We've all met this guy. Maybe we've all been this guy. Some people have a blame thrower. They just pass it on to everybody else and don't take responsibility for their actions and again hard to listen to somebody who's being like that. Penultimate the six of the seven, embroidery. Exaggeration. It means our language actually. Sometimes, for example, if I see something that really is awesome, what do I call it? and then of course, this exaggeration becomes lying out and outlying and we don't want to listen to people, we know aligned to us and finally, dogmatism The confusion of facts with opinions. When those two things get conflated, you're listening into the wind, you know, somebody is bombarding you with their opinions as if they were true. It's difficult to listen to that. So here they are seven. Deadly sins of speaking. These are things. I think we need to avoid, but is there a positive way to think about this? Yes, there is. I'd like to suggest that there are four really powerful cornerstones foundations that we can stand on if we want our speech to be powerful and to make change in the world. Fortunately, these things spell a word. The word is hail, and it has a great definition as well. I'm not talking about the stuff that falls from the sky and hits you on the head. I'm talking about this definition to greet or a enthusiastically. Which is, I think how our words will be received if we stand on these four things. So what do they stand for? See if you can guess. The honesty, of course. Being true in what you say being straight and clear. The a is authenticity just being yourself. A friend of mine described it as standing in your own truth, which I think is a lovely way to put it. The eye is integrity. Being your word actually, doing what you say, and being somebody people can trust. And the L is love. I don't mean romantic love. But I do mean wishing people. Well, For two reasons. First of all, I think absolute honesty may not be what we want. I mean my goodness you look ugly this morning perhaps. That's not necessary. Tempered with love, of course, honesty is a great thing. But also, if you're really wishing somebody, well, it's very hard to judge them at the same time. I'm not even sure you can do those two things simultaneously. so, hey, Also. Now that's what you say and it's like the old song. It is what you say, it's all. So the way that you say it, you have an amazing toolbox. This instrument is incredible. And yet this is a toolbox that very few people have ever opened. I'd like to have a little Rummage in there with you now. Just pull a few tools out that you might like to take away with which will increase the power of your speaking. Register. For example, now, full set a register may not be very useful most of the time, but there's a register in between. I'm not going to get very technical about this. For any of you who are Voice coaches, you can look at your voice. However, so if I talk up here in my nose, you can hear the difference. If I go down here in my throat, which is where most of us speak from most of the time. But if you want weight, you need to go down here to the chest. You hear the difference. We vote for politicians, with lower voices. It's true. Because we associate depth with power, and with authority. That's a register. And we have tambe it's the the way your voice feels again. The research shows that we prefer voices, which are rich smooth, warm like hot chocolate well, if that's not you That's not the end of the world because you can train, go get a voice coach. And there are amazing things you can do with breathing with posture, with exercise is to improve the Timbre of your voice. Then prosody I love prosody. This is the Singsong. The metal language that we use in order to impart, meaning its Route, 1 for meaning. In conversation, people who speak all on one note are really quite hard to Listen to If they don't have any prosody at all. That's where the words monotonic comes from, what monotonous monotony. Also, we have repetitive prosle now coming in where every sentence sends. It works question when it's actually not a question, it's a statement and if you repeat that one over and over, it's actually restricting your ability to communicate through, prosody which I think is a shame. So let's try and break that habit. Pace. I can get very, very excited by saying something really, really quickly or I can slow right down to emphasize. And at the end of that, of course, is our old friend silence. It's nothing wrong with a bit of silence, in a talk. Is there? We don't have to fill it with arms and Ours. Can be very powerful. Of course, pitch often goes along with Pace to indicate arousal, but you can do it just with pitch. Where did you leave my keys? Where did you leave my keys? Just slightly different meaning in those two deliveries. And finally volume. I can get really excited. by using volume, sorry about that by startled anybody or I can have you Some people broadcast the whole time. Trying not to do that. That's called casting imposing your sound on people around you. Carelessly and inconsiderate not nice. Of course where this all comes into play. Most of all, is when you've got something really important to do, it might be standing on a stage like this and giving a talk to people. It might be proposing, marriage. Asking for a raise. A wedding speech, whatever it is. If it's really important, you owe it to yourself to look at this toolbox and the engine that it's going to work on and no engine works well without being warmed up. Warmed up your voice. Actually let me show you how to do that. Would you all like to stand up for a moment? I'm going to show you the six vocal warm-up exercises that I do before every talk I ever do. Anytime you are going to talk to anybody, important do these first arms up. Deep breath in and sigh out like that one more time. Very good. Now, we're going to warm up our lips and we're going to go there very good and now Just like when you're a kid now your lips should be coming alive. We're going to do the tongue next with exaggerated la la la la la la beautiful. You're getting really good at this and then roll an R. That's like champagne for the tongue. Finally. And if I can only do one the pros, call this the siren, it's really good. It starts with we and goes to all the we is high, the oil is low. So we go Oh, fantastic. Give yourself a round of applause. Thank you, Steve, thank you. Next time you speak, do those in advance. Now, let me just put this in context to close. This is a serious Point here. This is where we are now, right? We speak not very well into people who simply aren't listening and that's all about noise and bad Acoustics I have talked about that on this stage in different phases. What would the world be like? If we were speaking powerfully to people who are listening consciously, its were actually fit for purpose or to make that a bit larger. What would the world be like if we were creating sound consciously? And consuming sound consciously and designing all our environments consciously for sound. That would be a world that does sound beautiful. And one way understanding. Would be the norm and that is an idea worth spreading. Thank you.
            
2024-11-20 18:57:16,299 - post_processing - DEBUG - Raw Gemini response: The human voice: the instrument we all play. It's the most powerful sound in the world, perhaps the only one that can start a war or say "I love you." Yet, many people feel unheard when they speak. Why? How can we speak powerfully to effect change?

I suggest we abandon certain speaking habits.  I've identified seven deadly sins of speaking. This isn't an exhaustive list, but these seven are significant.  We can all fall prey to the first: speaking ill of someone who's not present. It's an unpleasant habit, and we know the gossiper will soon be gossiping about us.

Second is judging.  It's difficult to listen to someone who's judging you.  Third is negativity. My mother, in her later years, became very negative, and it was hard to listen. I recall telling her it was October 1st, and she replied, "I know, isn't it dreadful?"  It's difficult to listen to constant negativity.  A form of negativity is complaining.  It's a national pastime. We complain about the weather, sports, politics—everything.  Complaining is viral misery; it doesn't spread sunshine.

Fourth is making excuses. We've all met, or perhaps been, this person. Some have a blame thrower, passing responsibility to everyone else. It's hard to listen to someone who refuses accountability.

Fifth is exaggeration.  If something is truly awesome, what stronger word is there? This exaggeration becomes lying, and we don't want to listen to liars.

Sixth is dogmatism: the confusion of facts with opinions. When these conflate, it's like listening to the wind. Someone bombards you with opinions as if they were facts. It's difficult to listen.

Finally, seventh is gossip (addressed earlier as speaking ill of someone not present).

These are seven deadly sins of speaking to avoid.  But is there a positive approach? Yes. Four powerful cornerstones can make our speech powerful and effective.  These form the word "HAIL," which means to greet enthusiastically. This is how our words will be received if we embrace these principles.

H is for Honesty: being truthful and clear. A is for Authenticity: being yourself. A friend described it as "standing in your own truth." I is for Integrity: keeping your word and being trustworthy. L is for Love: wishing people well.  Honesty tempered with love is crucial.  While honesty is important, saying "You look ugly this morning" isn't necessary.  Also, if you genuinely wish someone well, it's hard to judge them simultaneously.

How you say something matters.  You have an amazing toolbox—your voice—but few people explore its potential. Let's examine a few tools.

Register: Your vocal range. While a full range isn't always useful, speaking from your chest adds weight and authority. We associate deeper voices with power.

Timbre: The quality of your voice. Research shows we prefer rich, smooth, warm voices.  If that's not you, don't worry.  Voice coaching can improve timbre through breathing, posture, and exercises.

Prosody: The intonation and rhythm of speech.  People who speak monotonously are difficult to listen to.  Avoid repetitive upspeak, where every statement sounds like a question.

Pace: Varying your speed for emphasis.  Slowing down or speeding up can highlight key points. Silence can also be powerful; it doesn't need to be filled with "ums" and "ahs."

Pitch:  Like pace, pitch indicates emotional state.  Subtle pitch changes alter meaning.

Volume:  Use volume strategically for emphasis, but avoid broadcasting—imposing your voice on others.

These tools are especially important for crucial conversations: giving a talk, proposing marriage, asking for a raise, delivering a wedding speech.  Warm up your voice beforehand.  I use six vocal warm-up exercises: deep breaths and sighs, lip trills, tongue trills, rolling "r" sounds, and sirens (sliding from a high "wee" to a low "ooh").

We currently speak poorly to people who aren't listening, amidst noise and bad acoustics.  Imagine a world where we speak powerfully to people who listen consciously. Imagine creating, consuming, and designing environments consciously for sound. That world sounds beautiful, where understanding is the norm.  That's an idea worth spreading. Thank you.

2024-11-20 18:57:23,335 - post_processing - DEBUG - Raw Gemini response: Julian Treasure's TED Talk explores how to speak so that people want to listen, emphasizing the power of the human voice and its potential for both positive and negative impact.  He identifies seven "deadly sins" of speaking that hinder effective communication: gossiping, judging, negativity, complaining, excuses, exaggeration, and dogmatism. These habits make it difficult for listeners to engage and connect with the speaker.

Conversely, Treasure offers four cornerstones of powerful speech, summarized by the acronym HAIL: Honesty, Authenticity, Integrity, and Love. By embracing these principles, speakers can create a more receptive and positive environment for communication.  He argues that honesty combined with genuine care for the listener allows for impactful and meaningful dialogue.

Beyond content, Treasure highlights the importance of *how* we speak. He details six vocal tools: register, timbre, prosody, pace, pitch, and volume. Mastering these elements allows speakers to better control their delivery and connect with their audience. He suggests specific vocal exercises to warm up and improve voice quality.

Treasure's overall tone is optimistic and encouraging. He envisions a "sonorous world" where people speak powerfully and listen consciously, fostering greater understanding and connection.  The key stakeholders are anyone who communicates, encompassing personal and professional interactions. While no specific data points are presented, the talk relies on anecdotal evidence and established communication principles.  Treasure's ultimate conclusion is that by avoiding negative speaking habits and embracing positive principles, coupled with effective vocal techniques, we can transform the way we communicate and create a more harmonious and understanding world.

            Text: The human voice: the instrument we all play. It's the most powerful sound in the world, perhaps the only one that can start a war or say "I love you." Yet, many people feel unheard when they speak. Why? How can we speak powerfully to effect change?

I suggest we abandon certain speaking habits.  I've identified seven deadly sins of speaking. This isn't an exhaustive list, but these seven are significant.  We can all fall prey to the first: speaking ill of someone who's not present. It's an unpleasant habit, and we know the gossiper will soon be gossiping about us.

Second is judging.  It's difficult to listen to someone who's judging you.  Third is negativity. My mother, in her later years, became very negative, and it was hard to listen. I recall telling her it was October 1st, and she replied, "I know, isn't it dreadful?"  It's difficult to listen to constant negativity.  A form of negativity is complaining.  It's a national pastime. We complain about the weather, sports, politics—everything.  Complaining is viral misery; it doesn't spread sunshine.

Fourth is making excuses. We've all met, or perhaps been, this person. Some have a blame thrower, passing responsibility to everyone else. It's hard to listen to someone who refuses accountability.

Fifth is exaggeration.  If something is truly awesome, what stronger word is there? This exaggeration becomes lying, and we don't want to listen to liars.

Sixth is dogmatism: the confusion of facts with opinions. When these conflate, it's like listening to the wind. Someone bombards you with opinions as if they were facts. It's difficult to listen.

Finally, seventh is gossip (addressed earlier as speaking ill of someone not present).

These are seven deadly sins of speaking to avoid.  But is there a positive approach? Yes. Four powerful cornerstones can make our speech powerful and effective.  These form the word "HAIL," which means to greet enthusiastically. This is how our words will be received if we embrace these principles.

H is for Honesty: being truthful and clear. A is for Authenticity: being yourself. A friend described it as "standing in your own truth." I is for Integrity: keeping your word and being trustworthy. L is for Love: wishing people well.  Honesty tempered with love is crucial.  While honesty is important, saying "You look ugly this morning" isn't necessary.  Also, if you genuinely wish someone well, it's hard to judge them simultaneously.

How you say something matters.  You have an amazing toolbox—your voice—but few people explore its potential. Let's examine a few tools.

Register: Your vocal range. While a full range isn't always useful, speaking from your chest adds weight and authority. We associate deeper voices with power.

Timbre: The quality of your voice. Research shows we prefer rich, smooth, warm voices.  If that's not you, don't worry.  Voice coaching can improve timbre through breathing, posture, and exercises.

Prosody: The intonation and rhythm of speech.  People who speak monotonously are difficult to listen to.  Avoid repetitive upspeak, where every statement sounds like a question.

Pace: Varying your speed for emphasis.  Slowing down or speeding up can highlight key points. Silence can also be powerful; it doesn't need to be filled with "ums" and "ahs."

Pitch:  Like pace, pitch indicates emotional state.  Subtle pitch changes alter meaning.

Volume:  Use volume strategically for emphasis, but avoid broadcasting—imposing your voice on others.

These tools are especially important for crucial conversations: giving a talk, proposing marriage, asking for a raise, delivering a wedding speech.  Warm up your voice beforehand.  I use six vocal warm-up exercises: deep breaths and sighs, lip trills, tongue trills, rolling "r" sounds, and sirens (sliding from a high "wee" to a low "ooh").

We currently speak poorly to people who aren't listening, amidst noise and bad acoustics.  Imagine a world where we speak powerfully to people who listen consciously. Imagine creating, consuming, and designing environments consciously for sound. That world sounds beautiful, where understanding is the norm.  That's an idea worth spreading. Thank you.

            The human voice. It's the instrument, we all play. It's the most powerful sound in the world. Probably, it's the only one that can start a war or say I love you. And yet many people have the experience that when they speak people, don't listen to them. Why is that? How can we speak powerfully to make change in the world? What I like to suggest there are a number of habits that we need to move away from. I've assembled for your pleasure here, seven deadly, sins of speaking. I'm not pretending, this is an exhaustive list but these seven I think are pretty large. How about that? We can all fall into first. Got it. Speaking ill of somebody who's not present. Not a nice habit and we know perfectly. Well, the person gossiping five minutes later will be gossiping about us. Second judging we know people who are like this in conversation and it's very hard to listen to somebody. If you know that you're being judged and found wanting at the same time for negativity, You can fall into this my mother in the last years of her life became very, very negative and it's hard to listen. I remember one day, I said to her, it's October the first today and she said I know is it Dreadful? It's hard to listen when somebody's that negative. And another form of negativity complaining. Well, this is the National Art of the UK. It's our national sport. We can play in about the weather about sport about politics about everything, but actually complaining is viral misery. It's not spreading sunshine and lightness in the world. Excuses. We've all met this guy. Maybe we've all been this guy. Some people have a blame thrower. They just pass it on to everybody else and don't take responsibility for their actions and again hard to listen to somebody who's being like that. Penultimate the six of the seven, embroidery. Exaggeration. It means our language actually. Sometimes, for example, if I see something that really is awesome, what do I call it? and then of course, this exaggeration becomes lying out and outlying and we don't want to listen to people, we know aligned to us and finally, dogmatism The confusion of facts with opinions. When those two things get conflated, you're listening into the wind, you know, somebody is bombarding you with their opinions as if they were true. It's difficult to listen to that. So here they are seven. Deadly sins of speaking. These are things. I think we need to avoid, but is there a positive way to think about this? Yes, there is. I'd like to suggest that there are four really powerful cornerstones foundations that we can stand on if we want our speech to be powerful and to make change in the world. Fortunately, these things spell a word. The word is hail, and it has a great definition as well. I'm not talking about the stuff that falls from the sky and hits you on the head. I'm talking about this definition to greet or a enthusiastically. Which is, I think how our words will be received if we stand on these four things. So what do they stand for? See if you can guess. The honesty, of course. Being true in what you say being straight and clear. The a is authenticity just being yourself. A friend of mine described it as standing in your own truth, which I think is a lovely way to put it. The eye is integrity. Being your word actually, doing what you say, and being somebody people can trust. And the L is love. I don't mean romantic love. But I do mean wishing people. Well, For two reasons. First of all, I think absolute honesty may not be what we want. I mean my goodness you look ugly this morning perhaps. That's not necessary. Tempered with love, of course, honesty is a great thing. But also, if you're really wishing somebody, well, it's very hard to judge them at the same time. I'm not even sure you can do those two things simultaneously. so, hey, Also. Now that's what you say and it's like the old song. It is what you say, it's all. So the way that you say it, you have an amazing toolbox. This instrument is incredible. And yet this is a toolbox that very few people have ever opened. I'd like to have a little Rummage in there with you now. Just pull a few tools out that you might like to take away with which will increase the power of your speaking. Register. For example, now, full set a register may not be very useful most of the time, but there's a register in between. I'm not going to get very technical about this. For any of you who are Voice coaches, you can look at your voice. However, so if I talk up here in my nose, you can hear the difference. If I go down here in my throat, which is where most of us speak from most of the time. But if you want weight, you need to go down here to the chest. You hear the difference. We vote for politicians, with lower voices. It's true. Because we associate depth with power, and with authority. That's a register. And we have tambe it's the the way your voice feels again. The research shows that we prefer voices, which are rich smooth, warm like hot chocolate well, if that's not you That's not the end of the world because you can train, go get a voice coach. And there are amazing things you can do with breathing with posture, with exercise is to improve the Timbre of your voice. Then prosody I love prosody. This is the Singsong. The metal language that we use in order to impart, meaning its Route, 1 for meaning. In conversation, people who speak all on one note are really quite hard to Listen to If they don't have any prosody at all. That's where the words monotonic comes from, what monotonous monotony. Also, we have repetitive prosle now coming in where every sentence sends. It works question when it's actually not a question, it's a statement and if you repeat that one over and over, it's actually restricting your ability to communicate through, prosody which I think is a shame. So let's try and break that habit. Pace. I can get very, very excited by saying something really, really quickly or I can slow right down to emphasize. And at the end of that, of course, is our old friend silence. It's nothing wrong with a bit of silence, in a talk. Is there? We don't have to fill it with arms and Ours. Can be very powerful. Of course, pitch often goes along with Pace to indicate arousal, but you can do it just with pitch. Where did you leave my keys? Where did you leave my keys? Just slightly different meaning in those two deliveries. And finally volume. I can get really excited. by using volume, sorry about that by startled anybody or I can have you Some people broadcast the whole time. Trying not to do that. That's called casting imposing your sound on people around you. Carelessly and inconsiderate not nice. Of course where this all comes into play. Most of all, is when you've got something really important to do, it might be standing on a stage like this and giving a talk to people. It might be proposing, marriage. Asking for a raise. A wedding speech, whatever it is. If it's really important, you owe it to yourself to look at this toolbox and the engine that it's going to work on and no engine works well without being warmed up. Warmed up your voice. Actually let me show you how to do that. Would you all like to stand up for a moment? I'm going to show you the six vocal warm-up exercises that I do before every talk I ever do. Anytime you are going to talk to anybody, important do these first arms up. Deep breath in and sigh out like that one more time. Very good. Now, we're going to warm up our lips and we're going to go there very good and now Just like when you're a kid now your lips should be coming alive. We're going to do the tongue next with exaggerated la la la la la la beautiful. You're getting really good at this and then roll an R. That's like champagne for the tongue. Finally. And if I can only do one the pros, call this the siren, it's really good. It starts with we and goes to all the we is high, the oil is low. So we go Oh, fantastic. Give yourself a round of applause. Thank you, Steve, thank you. Next time you speak, do those in advance. Now, let me just put this in context to close. This is a serious Point here. This is where we are now, right? We speak not very well into people who simply aren't listening and that's all about noise and bad Acoustics I have talked about that on this stage in different phases. What would the world be like? If we were speaking powerfully to people who are listening consciously, its were actually fit for purpose or to make that a bit larger. What would the world be like if we were creating sound consciously? And consuming sound consciously and designing all our environments consciously for sound. That would be a world that does sound beautiful. And one way understanding. Would be the norm and that is an idea worth spreading. Thank you.

It's arguably the most powerful sound in the world—the only one that can start a war or say "I love you." Yet, many people feel unheard when they speak. Why?

Sixth, dogmatism—the confusion of facts with opinions. When these conflate, you're listening to someone bombard you with opinions as if they were truths.  Finally, seventh, the way you say things. You have an amazing toolbox—your voice—but few people explore its potential.

Let's examine a few tools. Register:  A full vocal range isn't always useful, but there's a middle ground. Speaking from the throat is common, but for weight, speak from the chest. We vote for politicians with lower voices because we associate depth with power and authority.

Timbre: Research shows we prefer voices that are rich, smooth, and warm. If that's not your natural timbre, a voice coach can help. Breathing, posture, and exercises can improve timbre.

Prosody:  This is the singsong, the meta-language that imparts meaning.  Monotonous speakers are hard to listen to.  Repetitive upspeak, where every sentence ends with a question mark, restricts communication.  Let's break that habit.

Pace:  Varying pace emphasizes points.  Silence is powerful; we needn't fill it with "ums" and "ahs."  Pitch, often linked with pace, indicates arousal.  Volume:  Used effectively, it conveys excitement.  Broadcasting—imposing your sound on others—is inconsiderate.

These tools are crucial for important moments: giving a talk, proposing marriage, asking for a raise, delivering a wedding speech.  Warm up your voice beforehand.  Here are six exercises I do: (1) Deep breaths and sighs. (2) Lip warm-ups: "Brrrr." (3) Tongue warm-ups: exaggerated "La la la." (4) Rolling R's. (5) The siren: "Wee-ooo."

This is a serious point. Currently, we speak poorly to people who aren't listening.  This is about noise and bad acoustics.  What if we spoke powerfully to people who were listening consciously? What if we created, consumed, and designed environments consciously for sound? That world would sound beautiful, and understanding would be the norm. That's an idea worth spreading. Thank you.

Transcript: The human voice.  It's the instrument, we all play.  It's the most powerful sound in the world. Probably, it's the only one that can start a war or say I love you.  And yet many people have the experience that when they speak people, don't listen to them. Why is that? How can we speak powerfully to make change in the world? What I like to suggest there are a number of habits that we need to move away from. I've assembled for your pleasure here, seven deadly, sins of speaking. I'm not pretending, this is an exhaustive list but these seven I think are pretty large.  How about that? We can all fall into first.  Got it.  Speaking ill of somebody who's not present.  Not a nice habit and we know perfectly. Well, the person gossiping five minutes later will be gossiping about us.  Second judging we know people who are like this in conversation and it's very hard to listen to somebody. If you know that you're being judged and found wanting at the same time for negativity, You can fall into this my mother in the last years of her life became very, very negative and it's hard to listen. I remember one day, I said to her, it's October the first today and she said I know is it Dreadful?  It's hard to listen when somebody's that negative.  And another form of negativity complaining. Well, this is the National Art of the UK. It's our national sport. We can play in about the weather about sport about politics about everything, but actually complaining is viral misery. It's not spreading sunshine and lightness in the world.  Excuses.  We've all met this guy. Maybe we've all been this guy. Some people have a blame thrower.  They just pass it on to everybody else and don't take responsibility for their actions and again hard to listen to somebody who's being like that.  Penultimate the six of the seven, embroidery.  Exaggeration.  It means our language actually. Sometimes, for example, if I see something that really is awesome, what do I call it?  and then of course, this exaggeration becomes lying out and outlying and we don't want to listen to people, we know aligned to us  and finally, dogmatism The confusion of facts with opinions. When those two things get conflated, you're listening into the wind, you know, somebody is bombarding you with their opinions as if they were true. It's difficult to listen to that. So here they are seven. Deadly sins of speaking. These are things. I think we need to avoid, but is there a positive way to think about this? Yes, there is. I'd like to suggest that there are four really powerful cornerstones foundations that we can stand on if we want our speech to be powerful and to make change in the world.  Fortunately, these things spell a word. The word is hail, and it has a great definition as well. I'm not talking about the stuff that falls from the sky and hits you on the head. I'm talking about this definition to greet or a enthusiastically. Which is, I think how our words will be received if we stand on these four things. So what do they stand for?  See if you can guess.  The honesty, of course.  Being true in what you say being straight and clear. The a is authenticity just being yourself. A friend of mine described it as standing in your own truth, which I think is a lovely way to put it. The eye is integrity. Being your word actually, doing what you say, and being somebody people can trust.  And the L is love.  I don't mean romantic love.  But I do mean wishing people. Well,  For two reasons. First of all, I think absolute honesty may not be what we want. I mean my goodness you look ugly this morning perhaps.  That's not necessary.  Tempered with love, of course, honesty is a great thing. But also, if you're really wishing somebody, well, it's very hard to judge them at the same time. I'm not even sure you can do those two things simultaneously.  so, hey,  Also. Now that's what you say and it's like the old song. It is what you say, it's all. So the way that you say it, you have an amazing toolbox. This instrument is incredible. And yet this is a toolbox that very few people have ever opened. I'd like to have a little Rummage in there with you now. Just pull a few tools out that you might like to take away with which will increase the power of your speaking.  Register. For example, now, full set a register may not be very useful most of the time, but there's a register in between. I'm not going to get very technical about this. For any of you who are Voice coaches, you can look at your voice. However, so if I talk up here in my nose, you can hear the difference. If I go down here in my throat, which is where most of us speak from most of the time. But if you want weight, you need to go down here to the chest. You hear the difference.  We vote for politicians, with lower voices. It's true. Because we associate depth with power, and with authority.  That's a register.  And we have tambe it's the the way your voice feels again. The research shows that we prefer voices, which are rich smooth, warm like hot chocolate  well, if that's not you  That's not the end of the world because you can train, go get a voice coach. And there are amazing things you can do with breathing with posture, with exercise is to improve the Timbre of your voice.  Then prosody I love prosody. This is the Singsong. The metal language that we use in order to impart, meaning its Route, 1 for meaning. In conversation, people who speak all on one note are really quite hard to Listen to If they don't have any prosody at all.  That's where the words monotonic comes from, what monotonous monotony.  Also, we have repetitive prosle now coming in where every sentence sends. It works question when it's actually not a question, it's a statement and if you repeat that one over and over, it's actually restricting your ability to communicate through, prosody which I think is a shame. So let's try and break that habit. Pace. I can get very, very excited by saying something really, really quickly or I can slow right down to emphasize.  And at the end of that, of course, is our old friend silence.  It's nothing wrong with a bit of silence, in a talk. Is there?  We don't have to fill it with arms and Ours.  Can be very powerful.  Of course, pitch often goes along with Pace to indicate arousal, but you can do it just with pitch. Where did you leave my keys? Where did you leave my keys?  Just slightly different meaning in those two deliveries.  And finally volume.  I can get really excited.  by using volume, sorry about that by startled anybody or I can have you  Some people broadcast the whole time. Trying not to do that. That's called casting imposing your sound on people around you. Carelessly and inconsiderate not nice.  Of course where this all comes into play. Most of all, is when you've got something really important to do, it might be standing on a stage like this and giving a talk to people. It might be proposing, marriage. Asking for a raise.  A wedding speech, whatever it is. If it's really important, you owe it to yourself to look at this toolbox and the engine that it's going to work on and no engine works well without being warmed up.  Warmed up your voice.  Actually let me show you how to do that. Would you all like to stand up for a moment?  I'm going to show you the six vocal warm-up exercises that I do before every talk I ever do.  Anytime you are going to talk to anybody, important do these first arms up.  Deep breath in and sigh out like that one more time.  Very good. Now, we're going to warm up our lips and we're going to go there very good and now  Just like when you're a kid now your lips should be coming alive. We're going to do the tongue next with exaggerated la la la la la la beautiful. You're getting really good at this and then roll an R.  That's like champagne for the tongue. Finally. And if I can only do one the pros, call this the siren, it's really good. It starts with we and goes to all the we is high, the oil is low. So we go Oh, fantastic. Give yourself a round of applause. Thank you, Steve, thank you.  Next time you speak, do those in advance. Now, let me just put this in context to close. This is a serious Point here. This is where we are now, right? We speak not very well into people who simply aren't listening and that's all about noise and bad Acoustics I have talked about that on this stage in different phases. What would the world be like? If we were speaking powerfully to people who are listening consciously, its were actually fit for purpose or to make that a bit larger.  What would the world be like if we were creating sound consciously?  And consuming sound consciously and designing all our environments consciously for sound. That would be a world that does sound beautiful.  And one way understanding.  Would be the norm and that is an idea worth spreading. Thank you.

Transcript: The human voice.  It's the instrument, we all play.  It's the most powerful sound in the world. Probably, it's the only one that can start a war or say I love you.  And yet many people have the experience that when they speak people, don't listen to them. Why is that? How can we speak powerfully to make change in the world? What I like to suggest there are a number of habits that we need to move away from. I've assembled for your pleasure here, seven deadly, sins of speaking. I'm not pretending, this is an exhaustive list but these seven I think are pretty large.  How about that? We can all fall into first.  Got it.  Speaking ill of somebody who's not present.  Not a nice habit and we know perfectly. Well, the person gossiping five minutes later will be gossiping about us.  Second judging we know people who are like this in conversation and it's very hard to listen to somebody. If you know that you're being judged and found wanting at the same time for negativity, You can fall into this my mother in the last years of her life became very, very negative and it's hard to listen. I remember one day, I said to her, it's October the first today and she said I know is it Dreadful?  It's hard to listen when somebody's that negative.  And another form of negativity complaining. Well, this is the National Art of the UK. It's our national sport. We can play in about the weather about sport about politics about everything, but actually complaining is viral misery. It's not spreading sunshine and lightness in the world.  Excuses.  We've all met this guy. Maybe we've all been this guy. Some people have a blame thrower.  They just pass it on to everybody else and don't take responsibility for their actions and again hard to listen to somebody who's being like that.  Penultimate the six of the seven, embroidery.  Exaggeration.  It means our language actually. Sometimes, for example, if I see something that really is awesome, what do I call it?  and then of course, this exaggeration becomes lying out and outlying and we don't want to listen to people, we know aligned to us  and finally, dogmatism The confusion of facts with opinions. When those two things get conflated, you're listening into the wind, you know, somebody is bombarding you with their opinions as if they were true. It's difficult to listen to that. So here they are seven. Deadly sins of speaking. These are things. I think we need to avoid, but is there a positive way to think about this? Yes, there is. I'd like to suggest that there are four really powerful cornerstones foundations that we can stand on if we want our speech to be powerful and to make change in the world.  Fortunately, these things spell a word. The word is hail, and it has a great definition as well. I'm not talking about the stuff that falls from the sky and hits you on the head. I'm talking about this definition to greet or a enthusiastically. Which is, I think how our words will be received if we stand on these four things. So what do they stand for?  See if you can guess.  The honesty, of course.  Being true in what you say being straight and clear. The a is authenticity just being yourself. A friend of mine described it as standing in your own truth, which I think is a lovely way to put it. The eye is integrity. Being your word actually, doing what you say, and being somebody people can trust.  And the L is love.  I don't mean romantic love.  But I do mean wishing people. Well,  For two reasons. First of all, I think absolute honesty may not be what we want. I mean my goodness you look ugly this morning perhaps.  That's not necessary.  Tempered with love, of course, honesty is a great thing. But also, if you're really wishing somebody, well, it's very hard to judge them at the same time. I'm not even sure you can do those two things simultaneously.  so, hey,  Also. Now that's what you say and it's like the old song. It is what you say, it's all. So the way that you say it, you have an amazing toolbox. This instrument is incredible. And yet this is a toolbox that very few people have ever opened. I'd like to have a little Rummage in there with you now. Just pull a few tools out that you might like to take away with which will increase the power of your speaking.  Register. For example, now, full set a register may not be very useful most of the time, but there's a register in between. I'm not going to get very technical about this. For any of you who are Voice coaches, you can look at your voice. However, so if I talk up here in my nose, you can hear the difference. If I go down here in my throat, which is where most of us speak from most of the time. But if you want weight, you need to go down here to the chest. You hear the difference.  We vote for politicians, with lower voices. It's true. Because we associate depth with power, and with authority.  That's a register.  And we have tambe it's the the way your voice feels again. The research shows that we prefer voices, which are rich smooth, warm like hot chocolate  well, if that's not you  That's not the end of the world because you can train, go get a voice coach. And there are amazing things you can do with breathing with posture, with exercise is to improve the Timbre of your voice.  Then prosody I love prosody. This is the Singsong. The metal language that we use in order to impart, meaning its Route, 1 for meaning. In conversation, people who speak all on one note are really quite hard to Listen to If they don't have any prosody at all.  That's where the words monotonic comes from, what monotonous monotony.  Also, we have repetitive prosle now coming in where every sentence sends. It works question when it's actually not a question, it's a statement and if you repeat that one over and over, it's actually restricting your ability to communicate through, prosody which I think is a shame. So let's try and break that habit. Pace. I can get very, very excited by saying something really, really quickly or I can slow right down to emphasize.  And at the end of that, of course, is our old friend silence.  It's nothing wrong with a bit of silence, in a talk. Is there?  We don't have to fill it with arms and Ours.  Can be very powerful.  Of course, pitch often goes along with Pace to indicate arousal, but you can do it just with pitch. Where did you leave my keys? Where did you leave my keys?  Just slightly different meaning in those two deliveries.  And finally volume.  I can get really excited.  by using volume, sorry about that by startled anybody or I can have you  Some people broadcast the whole time. Trying not to do that. That's called casting imposing your sound on people around you. Carelessly and inconsiderate not nice.  Of course where this all comes into play. Most of all, is when you've got something really important to do, it might be standing on a stage like this and giving a talk to people. It might be proposing, marriage. Asking for a raise.  A wedding speech, whatever it is. If it's really important, you owe it to yourself to look at this toolbox and the engine that it's going to work on and no engine works well without being warmed up.  Warmed up your voice.  Actually let me show you how to do that. Would you all like to stand up for a moment?  I'm going to show you the six vocal warm-up exercises that I do before every talk I ever do.  Anytime you are going to talk to anybody, important do these first arms up.  Deep breath in and sigh out like that one more time.  Very good. Now, we're going to warm up our lips and we're going to go there very good and now  Just like when you're a kid now your lips should be coming alive. We're going to do the tongue next with exaggerated la la la la la la beautiful. You're getting really good at this and then roll an R.  That's like champagne for the tongue. Finally. And if I can only do one the pros, call this the siren, it's really good. It starts with we and goes to all the we is high, the oil is low. So we go Oh, fantastic. Give yourself a round of applause. Thank you, Steve, thank you.  Next time you speak, do those in advance. Now, let me just put this in context to close. This is a serious Point here. This is where we are now, right? We speak not very well into people who simply aren't listening and that's all about noise and bad Acoustics I have talked about that on this stage in different phases. What would the world be like? If we were speaking powerfully to people who are listening consciously, its were actually fit for purpose or to make that a bit larger.  What would the world be like if we were creating sound consciously?  And consuming sound consciously and designing all our environments consciously for sound. That would be a world that does sound beautiful.  And one way understanding.  Would be the norm and that is an idea worth spreading. Thank you.

Transcript: The human voice.  It's the instrument, we all play.  It's the most powerful sound in the world. Probably, it's the only one that can start a war or say I love you.  And yet many people have the experience that when they speak people, don't listen to them. Why is that? How can we speak powerfully to make change in the world? What I like to suggest there are a number of habits that we need to move away from. I've assembled for your pleasure here, seven deadly, sins of speaking. I'm not pretending, this is an exhaustive list but these seven I think are pretty large.  How about that? We can all fall into first.  Got it.  Speaking ill of somebody who's not present.  Not a nice habit and we know perfectly. Well, the person gossiping five minutes later will be gossiping about us.  Second judging we know people who are like this in conversation and it's very hard to listen to somebody. If you know that you're being judged and found wanting at the same time for negativity, You can fall into this my mother in the last years of her life became very, very negative and it's hard to listen. I remember one day, I said to her, it's October the first today and she said I know is it Dreadful?  It's hard to listen when somebody's that negative.  And another form of negativity complaining. Well, this is the National Art of the UK. It's our national sport. We can play in about the weather about sport about politics about everything, but actually complaining is viral misery. It's not spreading sunshine and lightness in the world.  Excuses.  We've all met this guy. Maybe we've all been this guy. Some people have a blame thrower.  They just pass it on to everybody else and don't take responsibility for their actions and again hard to listen to somebody who's being like that.  Penultimate the six of the seven, embroidery.  Exaggeration.  It means our language actually. Sometimes, for example, if I see something that really is awesome, what do I call it?  and then of course, this exaggeration becomes lying out and outlying and we don't want to listen to people, we know aligned to us  and finally, dogmatism The confusion of facts with opinions. When those two things get conflated, you're listening into the wind, you know, somebody is bombarding you with their opinions as if they were true. It's difficult to listen to that. So here they are seven. Deadly sins of speaking. These are things. I think we need to avoid, but is there a positive way to think about this? Yes, there is. I'd like to suggest that there are four really powerful cornerstones foundations that we can stand on if we want our speech to be powerful and to make change in the world.  Fortunately, these things spell a word. The word is hail, and it has a great definition as well. I'm not talking about the stuff that falls from the sky and hits you on the head. I'm talking about this definition to greet or a enthusiastically. Which is, I think how our words will be received if we stand on these four things. So what do they stand for?  See if you can guess.  The honesty, of course.  Being true in what you say being straight and clear. The a is authenticity just being yourself. A friend of mine described it as standing in your own truth, which I think is a lovely way to put it. The eye is integrity. Being your word actually, doing what you say, and being somebody people can trust.  And the L is love.  I don't mean romantic love.  But I do mean wishing people. Well,  For two reasons. First of all, I think absolute honesty may not be what we want. I mean my goodness you look ugly this morning perhaps.  That's not necessary.  Tempered with love, of course, honesty is a great thing. But also, if you're really wishing somebody, well, it's very hard to judge them at the same time. I'm not even sure you can do those two things simultaneously.  so, hey,  Also. Now that's what you say and it's like the old song. It is what you say, it's all. So the way that you say it, you have an amazing toolbox. This instrument is incredible. And yet this is a toolbox that very few people have ever opened. I'd like to have a little Rummage in there with you now. Just pull a few tools out that you might like to take away with which will increase the power of your speaking.  Register. For example, now, full set a register may not be very useful most of the time, but there's a register in between. I'm not going to get very technical about this. For any of you who are Voice coaches, you can look at your voice. However, so if I talk up here in my nose, you can hear the difference. If I go down here in my throat, which is where most of us speak from most of the time. But if you want weight, you need to go down here to the chest. You hear the difference.  We vote for politicians, with lower voices. It's true. Because we associate depth with power, and with authority.  That's a register.  And we have tambe it's the the way your voice feels again. The research shows that we prefer voices, which are rich smooth, warm like hot chocolate  well, if that's not you  That's not the end of the world because you can train, go get a voice coach. And there are amazing things you can do with breathing with posture, with exercise is to improve the Timbre of your voice.  Then prosody I love prosody. This is the Singsong. The metal language that we use in order to impart, meaning its Route, 1 for meaning. In conversation, people who speak all on one note are really quite hard to Listen to If they don't have any prosody at all.  That's where the words monotonic comes from, what monotonous monotony.  Also, we have repetitive prosle now coming in where every sentence sends. It works question when it's actually not a question, it's a statement and if you repeat that one over and over, it's actually restricting your ability to communicate through, prosody which I think is a shame. So let's try and break that habit. Pace. I can get very, very excited by saying something really, really quickly or I can slow right down to emphasize.  And at the end of that, of course, is our old friend silence.  It's nothing wrong with a bit of silence, in a talk. Is there?  We don't have to fill it with arms and Ours.  Can be very powerful.  Of course, pitch often goes along with Pace to indicate arousal, but you can do it just with pitch. Where did you leave my keys? Where did you leave my keys?  Just slightly different meaning in those two deliveries.  And finally volume.  I can get really excited.  by using volume, sorry about that by startled anybody or I can have you  Some people broadcast the whole time. Trying not to do that. That's called casting imposing your sound on people around you. Carelessly and inconsiderate not nice.  Of course where this all comes into play. Most of all, is when you've got something really important to do, it might be standing on a stage like this and giving a talk to people. It might be proposing, marriage. Asking for a raise.  A wedding speech, whatever it is. If it's really important, you owe it to yourself to look at this toolbox and the engine that it's going to work on and no engine works well without being warmed up.  Warmed up your voice.  Actually let me show you how to do that. Would you all like to stand up for a moment?  I'm going to show you the six vocal warm-up exercises that I do before every talk I ever do.  Anytime you are going to talk to anybody, important do these first arms up.  Deep breath in and sigh out like that one more time.  Very good. Now, we're going to warm up our lips and we're going to go there very good and now  Just like when you're a kid now your lips should be coming alive. We're going to do the tongue next with exaggerated la la la la la la beautiful. You're getting really good at this and then roll an R.  That's like champagne for the tongue. Finally. And if I can only do one the pros, call this the siren, it's really good. It starts with we and goes to all the we is high, the oil is low. So we go Oh, fantastic. Give yourself a round of applause. Thank you, Steve, thank you.  Next time you speak, do those in advance. Now, let me just put this in context to close. This is a serious Point here. This is where we are now, right? We speak not very well into people who simply aren't listening and that's all about noise and bad Acoustics I have talked about that on this stage in different phases. What would the world be like? If we were speaking powerfully to people who are listening consciously, its were actually fit for purpose or to make that a bit larger.  What would the world be like if we were creating sound consciously?  And consuming sound consciously and designing all our environments consciously for sound. That would be a world that does sound beautiful.  And one way understanding.  Would be the norm and that is an idea worth spreading. Thank you.

And at the end of that, of course, is our old friend silence.  It's nothing wrong with a bit of silence, in a talk. Is there?  We don't have to fill it with arms and Ours.  Can be very powerful.  Of course, pitch often goes along with Pace to indicate arousal, but you can do it just with pitch. Where did you leave my keys? Where did you leave my keys?  Just slightly different meaning in those two deliveries.  And finally volume.  I can get really excited.  by using volume, sorry about that by startled anybody or I can have you  Some people broadcast the whole time. Trying not to do that. That's called casting imposing your sound on people around you. Carelessly and inconsiderate not nice.  Of course where this all comes into play. Most of all, is when you've got something really important to do, it might be standing on a stage like this and giving a talk to people. It might be proposing, marriage. Asking for a raise.  A wedding speech, whatever it is. If it's really important, you owe it to yourself to look at this toolbox and the engine that it's going to work on and no engine works well without being warmed up.  Warmed up your voice.  Actually let me show you how to do that. Would you all like to stand up for a moment?  I'm going to show you the six vocal warm-up exercises that I do before every talk I ever do.  Anytime you are going to talk to anybody, important do these first arms up.  Deep breath in and sigh out like that one more time.  Very good. Now, we're going to warm up our lips and we're going to go there very good and now  Just like when you're a kid now your lips should be coming alive. We're going to do the tongue next with exaggerated la la la la la la beautiful. You're getting really good at this and then roll an R.  That's like champagne for the tongue. Finally. And if I can only do one the pros, call this the siren, it's really good. It starts with we and goes to all the we is high, the oil is low. So we go Oh, fantastic. Give yourself a round of applause. Thank you, Steve, thank you.  Next time you speak, do those in advance. Now, let me just put this in context to close. This is a serious Point here. This is where we are now, right? We speak not very well into people who simply aren't listening and that's all about noise and bad Acoustics I have talked about that on this stage in different phases. What would the world be like? If we were speaking powerfully to people who are listening consciously, its were actually fit for purpose or to make that a bit larger.  What would the world be like if we were creating sound consciously?  And consuming sound consciously and designing all our environments consciously for sound. That would be a world that does sound beautiful.  And one way understanding.  Would be the norm and that is an idea worth spreading. Thank you.

Transcript: The human voice.  It's the instrument, we all play.  It's the most powerful sound in the world. Probably, it's the only one that can start a war or say I love you.  And yet many people have the experience that when they speak people, don't listen to them. Why is that? How can we speak powerfully to make change in the world? What I like to suggest there are a number of habits that we need to move away from. I've assembled for your pleasure here, seven deadly, sins of speaking. I'm not pretending, this is an exhaustive list but these seven I think are pretty large.  How about that? We can all fall into first.  Got it.  Speaking ill of somebody who's not present.  Not a nice habit and we know perfectly. Well, the person gossiping five minutes later will be gossiping about us.  Second judging we know people who are like this in conversation and it's very hard to listen to somebody. If you know that you're being judged and found wanting at the same time for negativity, You can fall into this my mother in the last years of her life became very, very negative and it's hard to listen. I remember one day, I said to her, it's October the first today and she said I know is it Dreadful?  It's hard to listen when somebody's that negative.  And another form of negativity complaining. Well, this is the National Art of the UK. It's our national sport. We can play in about the weather about sport about politics about everything, but actually complaining is viral misery. It's not spreading sunshine and lightness in the world.  Excuses.  We've all met this guy. Maybe we've all been this guy. Some people have a blame thrower.  They just pass it on to everybody else and don't take responsibility for their actions and again hard to listen to somebody who's being like that.  Penultimate the six of the seven, embroidery.  Exaggeration.  It means our language actually. Sometimes, for example, if I see something that really is awesome, what do I call it?  and then of course, this exaggeration becomes lying out and outlying and we don't want to listen to people, we know aligned to us  and finally, dogmatism The confusion of facts with opinions. When those two things get conflated, you're listening into the wind, you know, somebody is bombarding you with their opinions as if they were true. It's difficult to listen to that. So here they are seven. Deadly sins of speaking. These are things. I think we need to avoid, but is there a positive way to think about this? Yes, there is. I'd like to suggest that there are four really powerful cornerstones foundations that we can stand on if we want our speech to be powerful and to make change in the world.  Fortunately, these things spell a word. The word is hail, and it has a great definition as well. I'm not talking about the stuff that falls from the sky and hits you on the head. I'm talking about this definition to greet or a enthusiastically. Which is, I think how our words will be received if we stand on these four things. So what do they stand for?  See if you can guess.  The honesty, of course.  Being true in what you say being straight and clear. The a is authenticity just being yourself. A friend of mine described it as standing in your own truth, which I think is a lovely way to put it. The eye is integrity. Being your word actually, doing what you say, and being somebody people can trust.  And the L is love.  I don't mean romantic love.  But I do mean wishing people. Well,  For two reasons. First of all, I think absolute honesty may not be what we want. I mean my goodness you look ugly this morning perhaps.  That's not necessary.  Tempered with love, of course, honesty is a great thing. But also, if you're really wishing somebody, well, it's very hard to judge them at the same time. I'm not even sure you can do those two things simultaneously.  so, hey,  Also. Now that's what you say and it's like the old song. It is what you say, it's all. So the way that you say it, you have an amazing toolbox. This instrument is incredible. And yet this is a toolbox that very few people have ever opened. I'd like to have a little Rummage in there with you now. Just pull a few tools out that you might like to take away with which will increase the power of your speaking.  Register. For example, now, full set a register may not be very useful most of the time, but there's a register in between. I'm not going to get very technical about this. For any of you who are Voice coaches, you can look at your voice. However, so if I talk up here in my nose, you can hear the difference. If I go down here in my throat, which is where most of us speak from most of the time. But if you want weight, you need to go down here to the chest. You hear the difference.  We vote for politicians, with lower voices. It's true. Because we associate depth with power, and with authority.  That's a register.  And we have tambe it's the the way your voice feels again. The research shows that we prefer voices, which are rich smooth, warm like hot chocolate  well, if that's not you  That's not the end of the world because you can train, go get a voice coach. And there are amazing things you can do with breathing with posture, with exercise is to improve the Timbre of your voice.  Then prosody I love prosody. This is the Singsong. The metal language that we use in order to impart, meaning its Route, 1 for meaning. In conversation, people who speak all on one note are really quite hard to Listen to If they don't have any prosody at all.  That's where the words monotonic comes from, what monotonous monotony.  Also, we have repetitive prosle now coming in where every sentence sends. It works question when it's actually not a question, it's a statement and if you repeat that one over and over, it's actually restricting your ability to communicate through, prosody which I think is a shame. So let's try and break that habit. Pace. I can get very, very excited by saying something really, really quickly or I can slow right down to emphasize.  And at the end of that, of course, is our old friend silence.  It's nothing wrong with a bit of silence, in a talk. Is there?  We don't have to fill it with arms and Ours.  Can be very powerful.  Of course, pitch often goes along with Pace to indicate arousal, but you can do it just with pitch. Where did you leave my keys? Where did you leave my keys?  Just slightly different meaning in those two deliveries.  And finally volume.  I can get really excited.  by using volume, sorry about that by startled anybody or I can have you  Some people broadcast the whole time. Trying not to do that.

Most of all, is when you've got something really important to do, it might be standing on a stage like this and giving a talk to people. It might be proposing, marriage. Asking for a raise.  A wedding speech, whatever it is. If it's really important, you owe it to yourself to look at this toolbox and the engine that it's going to work on and no engine works well without being warmed up.  Warmed up your voice.  Actually let me show you how to do that. Would you all like to stand up for a moment?  I'm going to show you the six vocal warm-up exercises that I do before every talk I ever do.  Anytime you are going to talk to anybody, important do these first arms up.  Deep breath in and sigh out like that one more time.  Very good. Now, we're going to warm up our lips and we're going to go there very good and now  Just like when you're a kid now your lips should be coming alive. We're going to do the tongue next with exaggerated la la la la la la beautiful. You're getting really good at this and then roll an R.  That's like champagne for the tongue. Finally. And if I can only do one the pros, call this the siren, it's really good. It starts with we and goes to all the we is high, the oil is low. So we go Oh, fantastic. Give yourself a round of applause. Thank you, Steve, thank you.  Next time you speak, do those in advance. Now, let me just put this in context to close. This is a serious Point here. This is where we are now, right?

            Transcript:
            The human voice.  It's the instrument, we all play.  It's the most powerful sound in the world. Probably, it's the only one that can start a war or say I love you.  And yet many people have the experience that when they speak people, don't listen to them. Why is that? How can we speak powerfully to make change in the world? What I like to suggest there are a number of habits that we need to move away from. I've assembled for your pleasure here, seven deadly, sins of speaking. I'm not pretending, this is an exhaustive list but these seven I think are pretty large.  How about that? We can all fall into first.  Got it.  Speaking ill of somebody who's not present.  Not a nice habit and we know perfectly. Well, the person gossiping five minutes later will be gossiping about us.  Second judging we know people who are like this in conversation and it's very hard to listen to somebody. If you know that you're being judged and found wanting at the same time for negativity, You can fall into this my mother in the last years of her life became very, very negative and it's hard to listen. I remember one day, I said to her, it's October the first today and she said I know is it Dreadful?  It's hard to listen when somebody's that negative.  And another form of negativity complaining. Well, this is the National Art of the UK. It's our national sport. We can play in about the weather about sport about politics about everything, but actually complaining is viral misery. It's not spreading sunshine and lightness in the world.  Excuses.  We've all met this guy. Maybe we've all been this guy. Some people have a blame thrower.  They just pass it on to everybody else and don't take responsibility for their actions and again hard to listen to somebody who's being like that.  Penultimate the six of the seven, embroidery.  Exaggeration.  It means our language actually. Sometimes, for example, if I see something that really is awesome, what do I call it?  and then of course, this exaggeration becomes lying out and outlying and we don't want to listen to people, we know aligned to us  and finally, dogmatism The confusion of facts with opinions. When those two things get conflated, you're listening into the wind, you know, somebody is bombarding you with their opinions as if they were true. It's difficult to listen to that. So here they are seven. Deadly sins of speaking. These are things. I think we need to avoid, but is there a positive way to think about this? Yes, there is. I'd like to suggest that there are four really powerful cornerstones foundations that we can stand on if we want our speech to be powerful and to make change in the world.  Fortunately, these things spell a word. The word is hail, and it has a great definition as well. I'm not talking about the stuff that falls from the sky and hits you on the head. I'm talking about this definition to greet or a enthusiastically. Which is, I think how our words will be received if we stand on these four things. So what do they stand for?  See if you can guess.  The honesty, of course.  Being true in what you say being straight and clear. The a is authenticity just being yourself. A friend of mine described it as standing in your own truth, which I think is a lovely way to put it. The eye is integrity. Being your word actually, doing what you say, and being somebody people can trust.  And the L is love.  I don't mean romantic love.  But I do mean wishing people. Well,  For two reasons. First of all, I think absolute honesty may not be what we want. I mean my goodness you look ugly this morning perhaps.  That's not necessary.  Tempered with love, of course, honesty is a great thing. But also, if you're really wishing somebody, well, it's very hard to judge them at the same time. I'm not even sure you can do those two things simultaneously.  so, hey,  Also. Now that's what you say and it's like the old song. It is what you say, it's all. So the way that you say it, you have an amazing toolbox. This instrument is incredible. And yet this is a toolbox that very few people have ever opened. I'd like to have a little Rummage in there with you now. Just pull a few tools out that you might like to take away with which will increase the power of your speaking.  Register. For example, now, full set a register may not be very useful most of the time, but there's a register in between. I'm not going to get very technical about this. For any of you who are Voice coaches, you can look at your voice. However, so if I talk up here in my nose, you can hear the difference. If I go down here in my throat, which is where most of us speak from most of the time. But if you want weight, you need to go down here to the chest. You hear the difference.  We vote for politicians, with lower voices. It's true. Because we associate depth with power, and with authority.  That's a register.  And we have tambe it's the the way your voice feels again. The research shows that we prefer voices, which are rich smooth, warm like hot chocolate  well, if that's not you  That's not the end of the world because you can train, go get a voice coach. And there are amazing things you can do with breathing with posture, with exercise is to improve the Timbre of your voice.  Then prosody I love prosody. This is the Singsong. The metal language that we use in order to impart, meaning its Route, 1 for meaning. In conversation, people who speak all on one note are really quite hard to Listen to If they don't have any prosody at all.  That's where the words monotonic comes from, what monotonous monotony.  Also, we have repetitive prosle now coming in where every sentence sends. It works question when it's actually not a question, it's a statement and if you repeat that one over and over, it's actually restricting your ability to communicate through, prosody which I think is a shame. So let's try and break that habit. Pace. I can get very, very excited by saying something really, really quickly or I can slow right down to emphasize.  And at the end of that, of course, is our old friend silence.  It's nothing wrong with a bit of silence, in a talk. Is there?  We don't have to fill it with arms and Ours.  Can be very powerful.  Of course, pitch often goes along with Pace to indicate arousal, but you can do it just with pitch. Where did you leave my keys? Where did you leave my keys?  Just slightly different meaning in those two deliveries.  And finally volume.  I can get really excited.  by using volume, sorry about that by startled anybody or I can have you  Some people broadcast the whole time. Trying not to do that. That's called casting imposing your sound on people around you. Carelessly and inconsiderate not nice.  Of course where this all comes into play. Most of all, is when you've got something really important to do, it might be standing on a stage like this and giving a talk to people. It might be proposing, marriage. Asking for a raise.  A wedding speech, whatever it is. If it's really important, you owe it to yourself to look at this toolbox and the engine that it's going to work on and no engine works well without being warmed up.  Warmed up your voice.  Actually let me show you how to do that. Would you all like to stand up for a moment?  I'm going to show you the six vocal warm-up exercises that I do before every talk I ever do.  Anytime you are going to talk to anybody, important do these first arms up.  Deep breath in and sigh out like that one more time.  Very good. Now, we're going to warm up our lips and we're going to go there very good and now  Just like when you're a kid now your lips should be coming alive. We're going to do the tongue next with exaggerated la la la la la la beautiful. You're getting really good at this and then roll an R.  That's like champagne for the tongue. Finally. And if I can only do one the pros, call this the siren, it's really good. It starts with we and goes to all the we is high, the oil is low. So we go Oh, fantastic. Give yourself a round of applause. Thank you, Steve, thank you.  Next time you speak, do those in advance. Now, let me just put this in context to close. This is a serious Point here. This is where we are now, right? We speak not very well into people who simply aren't listening and that's all about noise and bad Acoustics I have talked about that on this stage in different phases. What would the world be like? If we were speaking powerfully to people who are listening consciously, its were actually fit for purpose or to make that a bit larger.  What would the world be like if we were creating sound consciously?  And consuming sound consciously and designing all our environments consciously for sound. That would be a world that does sound beautiful.  And one way understanding.  Would be the norm and that is an idea worth spreading. Thank you.
