Pegasus. Pegasus. Pegasus. Pegasus. Which has been used to monitor and track journalists, human rights activists and dissidents across the globe. In collaboration with Forbidden Films, a two-part investigation. We immediately realized that this story would be huge. NSO was established with the ambition to make the world a safer place into powerful spyware. It's a military weapon used against civilians. This is extremely serious for democracies. Used around the world. There is no control over how countries use it, and they have been using it in the worst way you could imagine. Now on frontline, part one of Global Spyware Scandal, exposing Pegasus. Our phones are not just our phones. We call them phones, but they're not phones, they're computers. And they're like extensions of our body. They're with us all of the time. And if they are turned into a surveillance device, I don't think it's an exaggeration to say this was something that even George Orwell in 1984 couldn't imagine. It's beyond science fiction. On va se faire un brief. La base de données est vraiment explosive. Pegasus. Pegasus. Pegasus. Pegasus. Pegasus. This technology is so far ahead of government regulation and even of public understanding of what's happening out there. All of us suspected that if NSO group was giving authoritarian and repressive regimes such a powerful instrument of surveillance, that it was pretty likely that this technology would be abused. But none of us had been able to prove it on a systemic scale. De acuerdo con la pesquisa recabada por The Washington Post, The Guardian, Le Monde y otros medios. A joint investigation by 17 news outlets and from activists, lawyers and journalists are reportedly among those who've been targeted by the phones. 50,000 phone numbers belonging to some big-name politicians. 国家元首、皇室成员、政商要人和部分记者的手机。 The device that you have in your pocket could be a spy that is spying on your life. The list doesn't have any names. You have phone numbers, area country code, some timestamps as well, and it's a list that is about 50,000 phone numbers from 2016 to 2020. We can't explain where the list is coming from. We can't, of course, reveal who is our source. Officially, the Pegasus spyware is not working on any plus one US phone numbers. It's not possible. The numbers, they are mostly in 10 countries and most of these governments are known to be clients of NSO group who make Pegasus. Pegasus designed to infect phones, like iPhones or Androids, and once in the phone, it can extract and access everything from the device, the phone books, geolocation, the messages, the photos, even the encrypted messages sent by signal or WhatsApp. It can even access the mic or the camera of your phone remotely. It's like a person over your shoulder, a person who will see what you are seeing, a person who will watch what you are watching, your emails, your encrypted communication, everything. So, once you are infected, you're trapped. Hello, can you hear me? I can hear you. I don't see you. Hello. Hello Paul. Hello. Hi Dana. Hi, how are you? Hi Dana. Good and you? We decided to reach out to some partners, The Washington Post, The Guardian, and many other ones. We wanted to tell you about some information we have and about a new project we are starting. We had no names attached to the numbers. We needed more journalists, we needed reporters on the ground who could reach out to some victims. We need people with tech expertise. Uh, we still have to identify some numbers. Many of them actually haven't been identified yet. So, we need your help on this. The moment they mentioned the numbers of phone numbers that they had, the quantity of phone numbers, tens of thousands. I mean my jaw just hit the floor. There is a lot that concern India. Some people in Mexico. Information about Hungary, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan. If Forbidden Stories have got data that can identify not just who the customers of NSO are, but potentially point in the direction of who the targets are as well, this is a game changer. This could be transformative in terms of our understanding of the whole cyber surveillance industry. I specialize in national security reporting, so surveillance is part of my beat, so to speak. You could see patterns starting to emerge, and you could almost like touch, okay, that might be a story. You know, here's something that's happening in Azerbaijan. That might be a story. Okay, I see what the Moroccan story might be. It's like watching a photo emerge in a dark room. We will shortly be arriving at Elephant and Castle. Change here for Beckenham and Orpington. We at The Guardian, we've been reporting about NSO for a long time. We thought it was really important to hold this company to account. Israel has become a world leader in this industry and exports these tools all over the world. And if you like NSO group was in many ways, you know, the jewel in the crown. The NSO group was recently valued at 1 billion dollars. It is one of the most successful companies in Israel's startup space. NSO says they sell this software to governments around the world for legitimate purposes, fighting terrorism or violating local laws. Here was a company founded by three guys in 2010 that claimed to have 40 countries around the world buying its technology, that made bold claims about its technology being used to solve serious crimes and help facilitate national security inquiries. This was a big deal. I can tell you on the last 10 years we only found three cases of misuse, and we took very serious action that we are always taking, and these serious actions meant that we shut down the system completely. We only sell it to governments or to entities that we know or we want to believe that they will not misuse the tools, and this is how we check the customers, this is how we diligence them, and we have all the mechanisms to make sure that they are not misusing the systems. In the middle of Paris, in the middle of this big COVID crisis, we got everyone together to plan the investigation. Thank you. Sorry about that. Good. I'm Dana Priest at The Washington Post, and this is Craig Timberg who's joining me. Here is Carmen Aristegui and Sebastian Barragan from Aristegui Noticias. This is Paul Lewis in The Guardian, and Stef, many of you will know, writes a lot about NSO. This is the Le Monde corner. This is Martin, Christoph, and I'm Damien. Usually, we see reporters at other news organizations as our rivals. We compete against them. We never want to share information with them because, you know, we want to keep our stories to ourselves. And this is just a different way of operating. This is seeing other journalists as partners. We are really one group, one group with one goal, producing those complex stories and We worked with more than 80 journalists, and we set up a publication date of July 2021, that gave us about a year to investigate the list. Even in order to protect the source, that's clearly something that is very The main task for us and for all the partners was to identify the names behind the phone numbers. That was crucial. With phone numbers only, we can do nothing. The data is the beginning of the project. We need to find sources. We need to go on the field. This project is about who is paying on who in many countries, and those countries, most of them are very dangerous. So um We had a kaleidoscope of potential victims. We had the data, but how do we prove that Pegasus was on the phones? And that was always going to be the hardest thing about this project, which was we had data, which was a very good indication of who the persons of interest were to these government clients of NSO, but we couldn't know whether a phone had been hacked unless we conducted forensics on it. Claudio Guarnieri is the head of Amnesty International Security Lab. He worked on creating a methodology, a platform that we could use during our investigation to have phones analyzed. He is a key element of that investigation. Without his expertise, nobody in our team would have been able to detect traces of Pegasus in a phone. It's a piece of code that look very similar to all the others that you are running on your phone. It's just designed to do something that it shouldn't. Pegasus accesses the files on the device, accesses the records on the device, being from WhatsApp, being from the SMS, uh, that on the database that you have on the phone, or access the GPS of the device, record the audio, access to webcam, these kinds of things. Apple and companies like it try to create as many layers of complication as possible for an attacker, but the unfortunate reality is that against capabilities like those that Pegasus customers have, there's not much you can do from a digital security perspective. You can't really stop them meaningfully. You can only try to make it more complicated. At some point, we discover very crucial information, an information that changed entirely the project. For years, we heard rumors about the Pegasus spyware might have been used against Jamal Khashoggi, who was killed in 2018 in the consulate of the Saudis in Istanbul. The minute we've found out about this list, the first thing we all did was to check for any numbers related to Jamal Khashoggi or anyone we knew who was associated with him. And right away we found two numbers associated with the two women closest to him in his life. Jamal Khashoggi's murder really, in the history of The Post, stands out. He was an opinion writer for The Washington Post, very gentle, soft-spoken man. His voice became very important because he was the single most important dissident writing about the Saudi regime. Jamal, let me start with you. You've compared your crown prince to Putin, to Iran's supreme leader. You said he's creating quote an interesting form of dictatorship. How so? I still see him as a reformer, but he is gathering all power within his hand. As we speak today, there are Saudi intellectuals and journalists jailed. His murder was so cold-blooded, and we we still don't have the whole story. Jamal went to the consulate in Istanbul, and then he disappeared. Senior Turkish officials have reported that he is in fact in the building, and he is still here. His close friends and family are still trying to figure out what their situation is. There's waiting on an official statement. I spoke to his fiancée who was also here, who told us that they came here to issue a number of documents so they could marry. They dispatched an assassination team that landed in a plane in the in the airport and came in cars with tools to hack him up, to hack his bones, and carry him out in a suitcase or suitcases. Pretty soon after his murder people started asking, was Pegasus used against Jamal? The word is that you sold Pegasus to them, and then they turned it around to get Khashoggi. Khashoggi murder is horrible, really horrible, and therefore, when I first heard there accusations that our technology being used on Jamal Khashoggi or on his relatives, I started an immediate check about it, and I can tell you very clear, we had nothing to do with this horrible murder. I'm hoping that Hatice Cengiz, Khashoggi's fiancée, who we'd all gotten to know on television because she was outside the consulate when he didn't reappear, I'm hoping that Hatice will let us do forensics on her phone to see for certain whether she was targeted, and maybe if we get lucky, whether we can see what they took out of her phone. What I did is I analyzed all the available data on two Android phones and and one laptop belonging to Hanan. On one of the phones, it appears that there were two separate links to the Pegasus spyware that were actually opened. That shows that that she was Before Jamal's murder, Hanan had been detained and interrogated in the United Arab Emirates, which is, of course, a close ally of Saudi Arabia. They took me to office in the airport, then they took me to my house. They search the whole house. They take my devices, my family devices. They have the password. I was in investigation for 17 hours until I got tired. I slept in the floor. What Bill discovered was when she was detained at the at the UAE airport, somebody who took her phone, then opened a browser on her phone, and then typed in a URL that then directed the phone to a website known to Citizen Lab as being a Pegasus website that activates the infection. The link to Pegasus was actually typed into the web browser, character by character. They made a couple of typos actually while they were doing it, which tells me it was done manually. We have the smoking gun from Hanan's phone, which is the traces of the spyware. You know, almost certainly the spyware was installed and exfiltrated information from from her phone. So she was in my view monitored. He was telling me what he's doing and what his connection, what is movement, what is his state of mind. So you were communicating with her? A lot. They tracked my husband through me long time back before they killed him. Because he was telling me, only me, everything. I didn't know this much they track him through me all the time. Yeah. Why is this all coming in my life? They did track Jamal and kill him through me long time back. She allowed me to download her phone, to send a copy to Claudio and to Bill Marczak at Citizen Lab, who also conducts forensic analysis. What I did is I analyzed all the available data on two Android phones and one laptop belonging to Hanan. On one of the phones, it appears that there were two separate links to the Pegasus spyware that were actually opened. That shows that that she was Before Jamal's murder, Hanan had been detained and interrogated in the United Arab Emirates, which is, of course, a close ally of Saudi Arabia. Getting evidence on the device of Hanan, on the device of Hatice. All of that was breaking the narrative of the CEO of NSO group who told to the press that that spyware were never used against the Jamal or the relatives of Jamal. In the list, we saw more than 15,000 Mexican numbers. Mexico was among the very first customers of NSO group. One of Mexico's best-known journalists is Carmen Aristegui, and she was part of our investigation. She has maybe more followers than the president of Mexico, and we needed to understand who those phone numbers in Mexico belongs to. Hola. Hola Carmen, es Arturo de Forbidden Stories. ¿Cómo estás? ¿Cómo estás? ¡Qué gusto! Forbidden tuvo un universo de más de 50,000 números, pero había que saber de quién eran esos números. Se tenía que investigar uno por uno. Carmen, hay muchos contactos de tu teléfono en nuestra lista. ¡Uf! Okay. Lo que lo que podemos hacer ahora es que puedes entrar los números en tu teléfono para decirme a quién pertenecen los números. Así lo vamos a hacer. Tengo un directorio nutrido, y entonces, ese directorio lo cruzamos con los números de Forbidden y los números de mi directorio. El tercero es Sandra Nogales, que durante muchos años fue mi asistente. Ah, caray! Tengo aquí una cosa, una sorpresa. El séptimo número corresponde a Karina Maciel. Karina Maciel es la productora de mi programa en la cadena de televisión CNN en México. Otro colega periodista, de la revista Proceso, Alejandro Caballero. Al cruzar, ¡uc, uc!, empezaron a salir nombres, nombres, nombres, nombres, nombres, y nosotros decíamos, "¡Ah, ah, ah!, ¿hasta dónde va a terminar esto?" Ah, caray. El que sigue es Alejandro Encinas, es un muy importante político de la izquierda. Y estaban ahí políticos, diplomáticos, abogados, periodistas, activistas, defensores de derechos humanos. Ay, caray. Bueno, aquí te puedo decir que está mi hermana. Aquí aparece mi hermana Teresa Aristegui Flores. Es mi hermana, pero no está relacionada con ninguna actividad pública. Yo intuyo que aquí nadie se salva. Si hicieron esto, imagínate, ya perdieron el pudor, o sea, podían haber espiado a su gato, ¿no? Sí. A su perro, al al canario. O sea, ¿estás de acuerdo? A su propia a su propia familia. We knew from a previous investigation that Carmen's phone was heavily targeted with the Pegasus in 2015 and 2016. So from that date, she is still investigating NSO group, the Pegasus spyware, all the agents and operators who are using that in Mexico. Durante los años que fui espiada, estuvimos realizando investigaciones periodísticas importantes para México, relacionadas con la Casa Blanca del presidente Enrique Peña Nieto, una casa en un barrio muy lujoso de la ciudad de México, en posesión del presidente de México, de Enrique Peña Nieto y de su familia, que no podían explicar, que desde luego no podía haber obtenido el presidente con los ingresos que el presidente pudo haber tenido como presidente, como gobernador, o como hijo de una familia de clase media. Que yo sospecho que mi teléfono está intervenido, y el teléfono de mi hijo Emilio está intervenido, es cuando Emilio, un chico menor de edad, me pregunta: "Oye, mamá, ¿tú sabes por qué recibo estos mensajes tan extraños?" Y yo le digo: "Yo también estoy recibiendo mensajes extraños." Quisiera clic para ver algún problema de tu visa en Estados Unidos. Claro, claro, claro, claro. Que puede estar mal con tu visa, ¿no? Qué problema era imposible que no hicieras clic. A ver, yo veía mi visa y decía, "¿Pues qué vigencia tiene, tiene?" Fuera de la vigencia, ¿qué problema puede tener? Pero sabes, es algo que es inevitable que que hagas clic. Sabemos que Pegasus se vendió a la Procuraduría General de la República, se vendió Pegasus al ejército, se vendió Pegasus al CISEN, al sistema de inteligencia, se vendió Pegasus a algunas instancias de carácter público. No puedo decirles mi nombre. No puedo referir con exactitud la institución en la cual me desempeñé. Y puede resultar peligroso para mí la identificación y el conocimiento de que yo tengo o tuve acceso a cierta información. El sistema Pegasus era toda una novedad para nosotros. El procedimiento era tener el número del objetivo. Hacer lo que se denominaba la ingeniería social, que es búsqueda de información en fuentes abiertas del objetivo, con la finalidad de elaborar mensajes de texto que pudieran ser enviados al dispositivo móvil. Debería hacer uno o dos intentos muy precisos, con información que le resultara útil al objetivo y que este pudiera dar clic. Si lográbamos el el éxito que diera clic en el mensaje, eso automáticamente instalaba el software en el equipo móvil y a partir de ahí ya podíamos tener acceso al teléfono, toda la información. Los resultados eran increíbles, porque una vez que se lograba instalar, infectar el dispositivo, se tenía acceso pleno al equipo móvil. Era una pantalla negra. En la parte superior izquierda teníamos la visualización principal, y en la parte del lado derecho, abajo estaban, digamos, módulos o pestañas, en donde se tenía cada una de las aplicaciones de las que se extraía información. Por ejemplo, teníamos el cuadro de la aplicación de WhatsApp, Telegram. Abajo teníamos el micrófono, las cámaras, la geolocalización, y dependiendo de lo que nos interesara, le dábamos clic y era lo que se proyectaba en la visualización principal. A partir de la infección, cualquier información que sea eliminada, podemos verla nosotros, ya sean fotos o conversaciones, pero podemos seguir viéndolas. Cuando empiezas a saber qué cosa es Pegasus, te das de espaldas. Quedas desnudo frente a un poder que no sabes quién detenta, quedas vulnerable frente a alguien que está observándote bajo una lupa. Pueden estar contigo en la oficina, en la regadera, en la cocina, con un amigo, con una fuente, todo el tiempo. All the time during this investigation, we try every day to identify the person behind that phone number. This is what all the partners and Forbidden's team were doing most of the time. Basically the consortium had access to a list so of of potential targets. Exactly. To be sure that she was indeed infected or surveilled, we would have to run forensic analysis. What I feel this phone, your I was a little bit not sure to talk and I I don't know if my giving a quotes to you, it will help me. I don't know because I don't trust the governments anymore. So, I do not want to put myself or my family under risk. I I wish on stage. I really am not sure. Of course. Of course. I saw one number in the list that belong to a friend, a journalist in Azerbaijan. Her name is Khadija Ismayilova. She's an award-winning investigative reporter and an outspoken critic of the government, renowned for her exposés of corruption at the hands of the country's president. Azerbaijan, you have a lot of oil and gas. It's a dictatorship, and the dictator's name is Ilham Aliyev, and this person and this state is extremely violent against dissidents, political opponents, journalists. I first met Khadija Ismayilova in Azerbaijan in about 2006, 2007. Khadija Ismayilova relentlessly kept on exposing the wrongdoing and the corruption of the Aliyev regime. She showed how, you know, they were having their hands into a big chunk of the Azerbaijani economy. She was showing how they were, you know, taking money in a covert way, how they were stealing money basically from the people. And she kept on doing what she was doing, and she got arrested. She got thrown behind bars. After all this investigative reporting, Khadija became a prime target for the government in Baku and for the Aliyevs. I don't know how to to proceed with Khadija because I don't want us to put Khadija in danger. The thing that is quite difficult is how to get in touch with Khadija without communicating on electronic device. This is very sensitive, right? Yeah. This is very, very sensitive, especially for her because she's basically on probation, so that's gonna be a risk anyway. We learned that Khadija was about to go to Turkey for some personal reasons, and so we set up immediately a team who went to Turkey to meet Khadija once she landed in the airport. Nervous. I'm nervous too. I cannot stand still. This is Hatice. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Can you hear me? Hi, Hatice. Good to see you. Should we start recording? We can take it off, right? That's too long. Sorry, sir. Also, we have about 1,000 number from Azerbaijan. And you were among them? Oh. And then we also have some people who are your friends. Okay. Um. And what does that program do? So what the program does is it basically without you knowing, um, it it installs things on your phone, and then it allows Even if I didn't click on anything? Yes. So the the secrecy of this it's called Pegasus. And the secrecy of it is that you don't actually see or you you don't do anything. So before you had to you had to click on something to be infected. In this case, it all happens in the background, and you have no idea that you're infected. And when you're infected, it's transmitting your messages, your images, this everything that's happening on your phone, including on Signal, because they have the phone itself. And it's legal to sell it. Yes, so um, we what we know is that most likely, sometime in 2018 the government got it. Okay. And we have a lot of data from 2019, um, and you know, that was a big year of protests. You were on a hunger strike with other people. You guys had a women's march, you were leading the march. It's kind of the most like in the country. So one way for us to verify that you know, what exactly, you know, was done in your case would be to do forensics on your phone? Yeah, right now. Is there any way to avoid this surveillance? Yes, we will set you up with a new device that you will be able to use. On a phone? It's a verbal can't always be some way to do it, but there are other ways to communicate. Yeah. It's like it makes you to want to live in the bubble, but then like so no one can enter like in some sort of and then like living like living in the inside the condom, but then you cannot reproduce. This is her phone. You don't need any cables? No. Okay. Do you know if she still has a backup of? Yes, she does. Yes, she does. Well, right now I'm trying to jailbreak the phone. Hopefully it works. So right now I am navigating through the phone. So I'm looking for things that might have executed, network activity that is connectable to the company, any leftovers of malicious executions, accounts that we know of, anything essentially that tells me the history of this phone. That's interesting. It's not something I've seen before. We see processes that we know are connected to to Pegasus. We'll see some iMessage accounts that um that are connected to the attacks, because this might indicate what was the entry point. Oh, was Apple Music, what the Oh really? That's that's weird. So they might have started using Apple Music to exploit it? Um, I have to do some more digging on this because I need to look at what specifically these applications are. She's definitely among the ones most targeted. It's important to rectify this story, which is that these technologies are exclusively used for good purposes and for fighting evil and for fighting crime and terrorism and all that. Okay, so now Khadija is coming. Hi, Claudio. Hi. So now tell me how bad it is. Okay, um, there are definitely some records that that indicate various points where the phone seem to have been compromised. So I started feeling like a plague doctor in 1300. I'm basically kind of just keeping the death gown. I am contributing to creating a trauma here, and I can see it in many cases, this, like I can see it that they are right now they're going through a traumatic moment. And I'm like that person in the room that is breaking it. Um, there are also some more recent packets from even as recent as early May of this year, so until a couple of weeks ago. Um, but all in all, it seems like this probably extended between 2019 and 2020, 2020 at the very least. I've been told that you will not know what exactly had been monitored or recorded. With this kinds of kinds of monitoring technology, at the point where they have that level of access to the device, virtually everything is possible. So Yeah, thank you. Have a good day. Bye-bye. Bye. Right. That's not great news. All night I've been thinking about what did I do with my phone, and I feel guilty. I feel guilty too for the messages I've sent. I feel guilty for the information sources that who sent me, thinking that some encrypted messaging ways are secure. They did it, and they didn't know that my phone is infected. I mean, my family members are also victimized. The the sources are victimized. Everyone, I mean, people I've been working with, people who told me their private secrets are victimized. Everyone, I mean, it's not just me. I I put so many people in danger. And and I'm angry. I again, I'm angry. I'm angry with the government. I'm angry with the companies that produce all these tools and sell it to the bad guys, like Aliyev regime. It's it's it's really it's despicable. It's heinous. Khadija is not a terrorist. Khadija is not a criminal. She's a journalist that is taking a lot of risks to write some stories, to make sure people will get access to independent information. So that was one more evidence of the global misuse of that spyware. Powerful governments managed to retain their power by seeing off threats from people who are campaigning for democracy or holding them to account, telling the truth. And, you know, here is a company that gave them a tool to do that. It's a military weapon used against civilians. And the civilians, they don't have any mechanism to help them in seeking justice, any mechanism to find some traces, any mechanisms to know that at least they are the target. You got a real sense that it was free-for-all. There is no control over how countries use it, and they have been using it in the worst way you could imagine. Even after months of investigating, we kept discovering new things, new names from the list, politicians, heads of state, even a princess. Hello. My name is Latifa Al Maktoum, and I'm making this video because it could be the last video I make. Yeah. For more on this and other Frontline programs, visit our website at pbs.org/frontline.
