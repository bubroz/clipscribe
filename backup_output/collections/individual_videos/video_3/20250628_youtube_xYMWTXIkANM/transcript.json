They suspected it contained numbers selected for potential surveillance with Pegasus. The Pegasus Project reporting consortium \u2014 which was led by Forbidden Stories and included 16 other media organizations, FRONTLINE among them \u2014 found that the spyware had been used on journalists, human rights activists, the wife and fianc\u00e9e of the murdered Saudi columnist Jamal Khashoggi, and others.\n\nOver two parts, this docuseries reveals the inside story of an investigation that prompted probes by governments and institutions around the world and sparked calls for an international treaty to govern the largely unregulated spyware industry.\n\nNSO, which has disputed some of the Pegasus Project\u2019s reporting, says that its technology was not associated in any way with Khashoggi\u2019s murder and that it sells Pegasus to vetted governments for \u201cthe sole purpose of preventing and investigating terror and serious crime.\u201d\n\nPart one of \u201cGlobal Spyware Scandal: Exposing Pegasus\u201d is available to stream here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZVj1_SE4Mo\n\nLearn more: https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/documentary/global-spyware-scandal-exposing-pegasus/\n\n#Documentary #Spyware #Surveillance\n\nFind FRONTLINE on the PBS App, where more than 300 of our documentaries are available to watch any time: https://to.pbs.org/FLVideoApp \nSubscribe on YouTube: http://bit.ly/1BycsJW \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/frontlinepbs \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/frontlinepbs \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/frontline \n\n\u201cGlobal Spyware Scandal: Exposing Pegasus\u201d is a FRONTLINE production with Forbidden Films.

    "full_text": "Pegasus. Pegasus. In collaboration with Forbidden Films, a two-part investigation. This story would be huge. NSO was established with the ambition to make the world a safer place into powerful spyware. It's a military weapon used against civilians. used around the world. There is no control over how countries use it. And they have been using it in the worst way you could imagine. Now on Frontline, part two of Global Spyware Scandal, exposing Pegasus. When you have your hands on a technology like this, the power must be quite intoxicating. You can get into the phone of most people in the world. And no one's looking over your shoulder. On va se faire un brief. La base de donn\u00e9es est vraiment explosive. Pegasus. Pegasus. Pegasus. It's like a person over your shoulder, a person who will see what you are seeing, a person who will watch what you are watching. Your emails, your encrypted communication, everything. So once you are infected, you're trapped. It was against so many people in civil society who clearly were not terrorists or criminals. And you got a real sense that it was a free-for-all. De acuerdo con la pesquisa recabada por The Washington Post, The Guardian, Le Monde y otros medios, A joint investigation by 17 news outlets and Forbidden Stories. Activists, lawyers and journalists are reportedly among those who've been targeted by the phone. phone numbers belonging to some big name politicians. NSO says they sell the software to governments for legitimate purposes, fighting terrorism or violating local laws. You have here a go-to spy service for tyrants. Oui, oui. Apr\u00e8s je comprends tout \u00e0 fait si vous souhaitez pas le, pas le faire aussi bien entendu votre droit le plus strict et Au revoir. Je pense qu'il va dire non lui. Il se trouve que parmi les personnes qui figurent dans la liste, il y a un ancien ministre qui n'est plus au gouvernement et qui donc a une, une forme de libert\u00e9 un peu plus grande que quelqu'un qui serait encore actuellement au pouvoir et c'est Fran\u00e7ois de Rugy. Donc on a contact\u00e9 Fran\u00e7ois de Rugy en lui expliquant qu'on souhaitait parler de quelque chose d'extr\u00eamement confidentiel. Vous \u00eates pas le seul ministre ou ex-ministre concern\u00e9, on en a au total 14. Et donc \u00e0 son cr\u00e9dit, il a il a fini par accepter et donc on s'est revu pour proc\u00e9der \u00e0 \u00e0 l'analyse technique de de son t\u00e9l\u00e9phone et qui nous a permis de confirmer qu'effectivement il avait bien \u00e9t\u00e9 cibl\u00e9 et qu'il avait bien \u00e9t\u00e9 cibl\u00e9 par le client qu'on avait identifi\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant le royaume du Maroc. Il n'a pas eu l'air du tout surpris quand je lui ai annonc\u00e9 le pays. Ah bon. Il m'a dit qu'il a rencontr\u00e9 le roi, ce qui est \u00e0 mon avis une bonne mani\u00e8re de le mettre sur les radars de ces gens. Le num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone qui est attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 Emmanuel Macron, la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape \u00e7a a \u00e9t\u00e9 de v\u00e9rifier que le num\u00e9ro \u00e9tait encore actif aujourd'hui et que c'\u00e9tait bien toujours Emmanuel Macron qui l'utilisait. Et donc le moyen le plus simple de v\u00e9rifier si il l'utilise toujours, c'est de lui \u00e9crire, donc en fait on va envoyer un SMS \u00e0 Emmanuel Macron. Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident de la R\u00e9publique. Nous publions la nouvelle enqu\u00eate internationale. sur le cyber. Hmm hmm. Donc vous-m\u00eame avez \u00e9t\u00e9 la cible ? Donc vous-m\u00eame avez \u00e9t\u00e9 la cible. C'est plus clair, soyons clair. En plus c'est pour \u00e7a. C'est \u00e7a que vous allez lui dire. Ah bah oui. Donc vous avez \u00e9t\u00e9 la cible. Ah non. Ouais. C'est parti. Et donc Emmanuel Macron ne r\u00e9pond pas directement \u00e0 ce SMS, mais une heure ou deux heures apr\u00e8s avoir envoy\u00e9 ce SMS, les services de l'\u00c9lys\u00e9e nous rappellent \u00e0 propos du SMS qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9, donc il l'a bien re\u00e7u, le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone est toujours actif. Ouais, ouais, bah l\u00e0 on va \u00e0 l'\u00c9lys\u00e9e l\u00e0. Quelques heures apr\u00e8s avoir envoy\u00e9 ce SMS \u00e0 Emmanuel Macron, on a re\u00e7u une invitation \u00e0 se rendre \u00e0 l'\u00c9lys\u00e9e. qui venait des services de l'\u00c9tat pour discuter de ce que nous avions trouv\u00e9. Bah, le rendez-vous quand m\u00eame de ce matin, l'impression que \u00e7a nous a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 tous, c'est vraiment le c\u00f4t\u00e9 panique, enfin pas panique genre mon Dieu c'est horrible ce qu'il a pu se passer, mais c'est plut\u00f4t mon Dieu, toutes les implications potentielles de cette affaire sur Il faut et plans judiciaire, diplomatique, s\u00e9curitaire, euh voil\u00e0, et que, et que en fait euh ils verrouillent, ils verrouillent la la communication. Assez rapidement les experts de l'\u00c9tat vont confirmer qu'il y a bien eu des tentatives d'infection ou des infections dans certains cas sur les t\u00e9l\u00e9phones de certains ministres euh et sur les t\u00e9l\u00e9phones d'un certain nombre de tr\u00e8s hauts fonctionnaires euh fran\u00e7ais. Le r\u00e9sultat des analyses du t\u00e9l\u00e9phone du pr\u00e9sident de la R\u00e9publique est class\u00e9 secret d\u00e9fense et on n'y aura vraiment jamais acc\u00e8s. We don't know exactly who in Morocco was using Pegasus. There were Moroccan dissidents on the list, even the King of Morocco himself was on the list. But we do know that NSO only sells to governments and government agencies. We were reaching out to another dimension of the project. We were at this stage entering a space, a dangerous space, where we were talking about a country, a state attacking another one. Each time you look at how a client of NSO Group used the technology, it tells you something about that government. In the UAE, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum is prime minister, vice president, and of course, the ruler of Dubai. Here is an autocratic leader, massively powerful. Princess Latifa is the daughter of Sheikh Muhammad. She had for a long time been, by her account, unhappy about her life in Dubai. She had been incarcerated effectively by her father's regime. I'm making this video because it could be the last video I make. Yeah. This video can help me because all my father cares about is his reputation. He will kill people to protect his own reputation. He he he only cares about himself and his ego. Princess Latifa concocted this extraordinary attempted escape that involved jet skis, a yacht and a trip to the Indian Ocean. I mean, it's an audacious thing to do. Incredible even that she attempted it. I think remarkable that it nearly succeeded. The day after Princess Latifa went missing from Dubai, we saw her number entered into the list. And in the days after that, as she was traveling toward India on this yacht, her friends, people she knew, people within her orbit, their phone numbers also appeared on the list. If you look at the dates and times that her number and those of people close to her were entered into the system, you have something that has to be more than a coincidence. Eight days after her escape, Indian special forces boarded the yacht, and then the princess was forcibly returned to Dubai. We don't know exactly why the attempted escape didn't succeed, but NSO's technology was, it seems, from the evidence we've seen, one of the tools that was being used by the state in a desperate attempt to find Princess Latifa, kidnap her and return her back to Dubai. We tried hard to get hold of a phone that Latifa had used but we couldn't. So we contacted her friends and her associates to ask if we could check their phones to see if they had been targeted with Pegasus. Given how much David Haig was working on the Latifa case, it wasn't a surprise when we discovered that there was Pegasus activity on his phone. I was infected on 3rd of August 2020 with Pegasus. I believe at 3:00 a.m. in the morning and the next day as well. The fact that you can be hacked on British soil, and that they can do that is frightening. It really is. My name's David Haigh from Detained International, then we founded the campaign to free the Dubai Princess, Princess Latifa in 2018. David Haigh was actually imprisoned in Dubai for alleged fraud, and it was after his release that he became a human rights campaigner. Princess Latifa began to message him after her failed attempted escape. This is a picture that Latifa drew of the jail villa, Villa 96 in Jumeirah, Dubai, near the Burj Al Arab. Um and you can see here at Beach this direction, where she was held captive. This villa has been converted into a jail. All the windows are boarded shut, I can't open any window. Uh there's five policemen outside and two policewoman inside the house. Uh I don't know what can happen to me and how long this will last and if they decide to release me, like how my life will be. But um, I'm not safe at all. That week before I'd hacked, our secret contact with Latifa had stopped suddenly. The several hours became a day and then two days. And then we started to worry because that was not normal. We had recorded a lot of videos and a lot of evidence Latifa had that could be used to tell the world about her predicament. The fact that she'd been held hostage. At the time I was hacked, we were in London with the videos that Latifa recorded, the evidence, to meet media to decide if we were going to use it at that time or not. It was effectively dynamite evidence on that phone. The fact that they know your location. That someone could be listening to us now and seeing what we're doing. And it's that sitting in the back of your head every day. We can't let NSO and the governments that abuse their system get away with what they've done. Because if we do and if nothing happens and people are not brought to justice, people are not put in jail and people are not taken to court. The next company and the next company and the next company wherever they may be, will do exactly the same. And it will just carry on, but get worse. The heart of the company is what we call vulnerability researchers. You take a system like the iPhone that the best engineers in the world worked on it, and you find a way to overcome it. But there is a well-oiled mechanism of recruiting army computer unit graduates to the civilian high-tech. To all kinds of companies. 8200 is a large unit within the army. And within that unit, they deal with offensive cyber of the Israel Defense Forces, of the IDF. When they need to extract information from our enemies, these are the people who will do it. They have knowledge that is rare. They take 18-year-old kids, train them very quickly, very deeply. Israel has this advantage of not only developing new technologies and weaponry, but testing it live. And this is something Israel knows it can use to sell outside. When you want to control a huge population like we do with Palestinians, you have to have assets everywhere. So everyone can be a target because you don't want only the, I don't know, terrorists from Hamas, but also maybe his neighbor or the his cousin or the person who sells milk in the corner of the street. If you want to recruit human agents, you need to collect their weaknesses, things that you can use to blackmail. And so part of what 8200 does is to collect this blackmail potential information about everybody. If your day or if you have medical, special medical condition or you have uh financial problems or someone from your family has one of those, then that's something we can use against you to blackmail you and get you to cooperate. Israeli intelligence has a strategic view of how their employees should be used after they leave their employ. They promote them. They want them to start these companies. And they see a deep communications, a continued relationship between the government and their former employees as valuable to Israel's national security interest. There's a lot of evidence to suggest that NSO Group had the the direct backing and support of Bibi Netanyahu's government. In order to sell its product to governments around the world, it required permits effectively, licenses from the Israeli Defense Ministry. I decided several years ago to turn Israel into one of the five uh cyber powers of the world. In order for the companies to develop, they need to make what do they need to make? Money. They need to make money. Now, the easiest way to make sure that they don't make money is one, high taxes, right? What's the other one? Regulations. Have you ever heard of regulations? We have a problem with regulations. So the policy we have is keep taxes low and keep regulations low. Minimize regulations. There is no industry more susceptible and more inviting of regulations than cybersecurity. It's like weapons. It is a weapon. The story of using a weapon as a diplomatic tool is not new in Israel. There is even a term for it. It's called diplomacy of the Uzi. And we found a match between the timelines between a visit of Netanyahu to a certain country or a visit of another country's leader to Israel, and the day when the NSO system was first operated in that country. Sometimes the system was operated before the state visit. Sometimes the state visit was before the system was operated. But the correlation was so strong that it cannot be ignored. One example is Hungary, which under the populist prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, the country has become one of Israel's strongest allies in the European Union. The timeline for Hungary is that the visit was in July 2017. And the operation of Hungary, we know almost the exact date, by the database of Forbidden Stories, it's February 2018. So similarities. Through this list of phone numbers, you can find numbers from Morocco, from Bahrain, from the United Arab Emirates, and from Saudi Arabia. So we know that the State of Israel wanted to get closer to them. It wanted to warm up relations with them. Photos that Netanyahu, of course not in Saudi Arabia, which is still unofficial and still what they call relations behind the scenes, we see that the State of Israel is beginning to understand the value that NSO has, that Pegasus has for some countries that do not have strong intelligence services, that do not have good technological capabilities. And Israel uses Pegasus as a diplomatic currency. As something that it can give to countries that it wants something from. And that's how to warm up relations or to advance in negotiations. And essentially, this is my small contribution to this amazing project called Pegasus Project. Going through all the numbers on the list was a huge job. More than 15,000 of the numbers were in Mexico. And one of those numbers belonged to a journalist who was murdered just three weeks after he was put on the list. Was Pegasus used in that case to spy on the journalist or to geolocate him? Sabes que ese se\u00f1or Pineda es tambi\u00e9n en la lista? S\u00ed, el que es el que fue asesinado? S\u00ed. Es en la lista, s\u00ed. Qu\u00e9 fuerte. En M\u00e9xico es muy grave que se haya usado Pegasus como se us\u00f3. Me remito al caso de Cecilio Pineda. Y de Pegasus Project lo mostr\u00f3 p\u00fablicamente que su tel\u00e9fono fue ingresado d\u00edas antes o semanas antes de haber sido cometido el asesinato. El estado de Guerrero es una de las entidades m\u00e1s impactadas por el crimen organizado. Hay lugares en donde literalmente el Estado ya no tiene dominio. Las autoridades en realidad est\u00e1n pues mezcladas con el crimen organizado. Y hay pues actividad del del narcotr\u00e1fico, hay actividad diversa delincuencial. De acuerdo con el reporte de la polic\u00eda, varios sujetos armados llegaron a un autolavado donde el periodista Cecilio Pineda esperaba que le entregaran su camioneta y le dispararon. No me sorprende que Cecilio Pineda estuviera en esa lista porque el tema que se estaba tocando era serio. y estamos cansados de violencia. Pero nadie eh tiene segura su vida. Tambi\u00e9n es verdad vivimos en un entorno en donde estamos solos, en una regi\u00f3n en donde todas autoridades pues no te no te apoyan, eh aqu\u00ed uno tiene que defenderse con sus propias u\u00f1as. Buenas tardes, amigos de Tierra Caliente, pues aqu\u00ed ya de regreso despu\u00e9s de estar en dos municipios de la regi\u00f3n y pues nos encontramos con esto. A Cecilio te hab\u00eda hecho un video. Ven\u00eda en camino y quiso dar un mensaje anticipado de lo que iba a presentar despu\u00e9s. \u00c9l dijo que unas horas despu\u00e9s iba a mostrar el video de la relaci\u00f3n que hab\u00eda entre el gobierno del Estado y el grupo del Tequilero. Despu\u00e9s de eso ya no present\u00f3 nada. Ah\u00ed lo asesinaron. Ese d\u00eda este fue Y ya al llegar a la cl\u00ednica este yo quise pasar a verlo. Entonces me dice la se\u00f1orita, dice, no, se lo est\u00e1n atendiendo. Entonces, yo pens\u00e9 pues que iba a estar bien. Dije, no, pues nada m\u00e1s fue pues algo. Ya como a los a los tres minutos sali\u00f3 el doctor. Dice, no, dice, pues ya, ya falleci\u00f3. Y es la \u00fanica vez en mi vida que que me he desmayado. Cuando volv\u00ed pues estaba toda aturdida, dije, pues no sab\u00eda qu\u00e9. Y pues ya, fue cuando me volvieron a decir pues que hab\u00eda fallecido. Que este, que ya hab\u00eda llegado pr\u00e1cticamente casi muerto pues. You can only prove infection if you do forensics on the phone and find traces of Pegasus. But in many cases the phone was not findable. That was the case of Cecil Pineda. No se puede afirmar categ\u00f3ricamente que lo que se obtuvo de el posible espionaje haya sido lo que provoc\u00f3 el asesinato. Pero tampoco podemos ser ingenuos. In some ways, we can talk about the impact on the company and say it's been really profound. A more pessimistic view would be to look at the entire industry. Which remains unreformed, pretty wild, unregulated. NSO may vanish. But I feel no more secure talking in front of my phone now than I did when we first published. You know, I don't think these issues have gone away.",

    "summary": "The transcript details a comprehensive investigation, 'Global Spyware Scandal, exposing Pegasus,' a powerful spyware developed by NSO. Initially aiming to make the world safer, Pegasus has become a military weapon widely used against civilians, including activists, lawyers, journalists, and politicians, with no international control. The technology allows complete surveillance, accessing emails, encrypted communications, and user's visual data, effectively trapping the infected individual. This pervasive misuse led to a major joint investigation by 17 news outlets, including The Washington Post, The Guardian, Le Monde, and Forbidden Stories.\n\nThe investigation uncovered several high-profile targets. In France, former minister Fran\u00e7ois de Rugy was confirmed to have been targeted by the Kingdom of Morocco, and analysis revealed that up to 14 ministers and ex-ministers were affected. The phone number of President Emmanuel Macron also appeared on the list, prompting an SMS inquiry that led to a high-level meeting at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e. This meeting highlighted significant concerns regarding the judicial, diplomatic, and security implications, with state experts confirming infection attempts on phones of French officials, though the President's phone analysis was classified 'secret defense.'\n\nBeyond France, the scandal implicated the UAE in the case of Princess Latifa, daughter of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum of Dubai. Imprisoned by her father, Princess Latifa attempted a daring escape. Her phone number, and those of her associates, appeared on the Pegasus list around the time of her disappearance and during her journey. Indian special forces subsequently intercepted her yacht, and she was forcibly returned to Dubai, with Pegasus technology seemingly used as a key tool in her recapture. Human rights campaigner David Haigh, who was working to free Princess Latifa, also had his phone infected with Pegasus while on British soil, reinforcing concerns about the spyware's reach and lack of oversight.\n\nThe broader implications are severe: the technology allows autocratic leaders to track dissidents and suppress freedom, fostering a culture of fear among those targeted. The transcript emphasizes the critical need for accountability for NSO and the governments abusing Pegasus, warning that a failure to bring those responsible to justice will only encourage other companies to develop similar intrusive technologies, leading to a worsening global surveillance landscape. NSO's ability to compromise advanced systems like iPhones stems from its 'vulnerability researchers,' often recruited from specialized military units like Israel's Unit 8200, highlighting a pipeline from offensive cyber warfare to civilian high-tech.",
