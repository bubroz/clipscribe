## Executive Summary

The press briefing commenced by highlighting significant achievements in border security under the Trump administration. It was reported that Border Patrol saw a 93% decrease in illegal alien crossings at the Southwest border compared to May 2024 under Joe Biden. A key accomplishment noted was that zero illegal aliens were released into the United States in May under Trump, a direct contrast to Biden's policies that allegedly wasted resources and jeopardized national security. The President's decision to terminate these "reckless Biden-era practices" was credited with the border's "unprecedented levels of operational success." The administration plans to intensify efforts to arrest and deport millions of criminal illegal aliens who entered during the Biden presidency, specifically targeting "sanctuary cities" with full support for ICE officers. Simultaneously, the briefing praised ICE officers as heroes upholding the rule of law.
