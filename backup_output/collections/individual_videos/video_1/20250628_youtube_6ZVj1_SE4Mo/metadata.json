They suspected it contained numbers selected for potential surveillance with Pegasus. The Pegasus Project reporting consortium \u2014 which was led by Forbidden Stories and included 16 other media organizations, FRONTLINE among them \u2014 found that the spyware had been used on journalists, human rights activists, the wife and fianc\u00e9e of the murdered Saudi columnist Jamal Khashoggi, and others.\n\nOver two nights, this docuseries reveals the inside story of an investigation that prompted probes by governments and institutions around the world and sparked calls for an international treaty to govern the largely unregulated spyware industry.\n\nNSO, which has disputed some of the Pegasus Project\u2019s reporting, says that its technology was not associated in any way with Khashoggi\u2019s murder and that it sells Pegasus to vetted governments for \u201cthe sole purpose of preventing and investigating terror and serious crime.\u201d\n\nSurveillance technologies like Pegasus are \u201ca military weapon used against civilians, and the civilians, they don\u2019t have any mechanism to help them in seeking justice,\u201d says Laurent Richard, founder of Forbidden Stories and Forbidden Films and one of the producers of the films.\n\nPart two of \u201cGlobal Spyware Scandal: Exposing Pegasus\u201d premieres Tues., Jan. 10, 2023.\n\nLearn more: https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/documentary/global-spyware-scandal-exposing-pegasus/\n\n#Documentary #Spyware #Surveillance\n\nFind FRONTLINE on the PBS App, where more than 300 of our documentaries are available to watch any time: https://to.pbs.org/FLVideoApp \nSubscribe on YouTube: http://bit.ly/1BycsJW \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/frontlinepbs \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/frontlinepbs \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/frontline \n\n\u201cGlobal Spyware Scandal: Exposing Pegasus\u201d is a FRONTLINE production with Forbidden Films.
