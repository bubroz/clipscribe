    "full_text": "Ambassador, uh, two questions through the China Central Television. First, a US Congressman today sent a letter to nominate President Trump Nobel Peace Prize. What is your opinion? And secondly, many leaders talking about another ceasefire, which is Gaza ceasefire. Do you think it's a good time now to talk about Gaza ceasefire? Thank you.\n\nWell, first I I think that President Trump deserves a Nobel Peace Prize. I think we should thank him for for his leadership, for the brave decision he took, uh, and to recognize the effort of the United States. Regarding your second question, yes, we hope to see, uh, a ceasefire also in Gaza. There is a proposal on the table that the Ambassador Witkoff put forward and we hope to renew the negotiations on that proposal.\n\nMr. Ambassador, um, can you tell us what the follow-up to this ceasefire announcement is going to be? Are there going to be diplomatic, uh, talks between Iran and Israel? Is this something that Israel would like to see? The Iranians have already indicated that they want to see talks.\n\nWell, it is after every military operation or conflict, you have the diplomatic, uh, efforts. And I I'm sure it will be the case also in this scenario. Because diplomacy failed, we had to act and the USA had to act. So I think yes, we will have to, uh, speak, negotiate, uh, and make sure that we will not repeat and get to the situation where we were 12 days ago when we had a major threat in the Middle East.\n\nWell, it's too early. It's too early. You know, we just, uh, announced about the ceasefire today, but I believe it will happen soon.\n\nAmbassador, you're talking about... Thank you so much. Lika, RIA Novosti. Um, would you support the Security Council, uh, having a resolution on the ceasefire between Israel and Iran? And would you maybe discuss it with your Iranian counterpart in person?\n\nSo, I I don't have any communication with Iranian representative at the UN. I don't think that we need a Security Council resolution. The parties accepted the proposal of President Trump. But, uh, maybe in the future there will be a place for involvement of the UN organization.\n\nAmbassador, Ambassador. Ambassador, I understand that most of its highly enriched uranium before the strike, before hours just Iran knows where it is and President Trump said that program was being eliminated. Israel agreed with that. What is your assessment?\n\nWell, I think it's still early to to assess, uh, all the strikes. We know we were able to push back the program. We were able to remove the eminent threat that we had. And Prime Minister Netanyahu spoke about the UN, you mentioned that we think we have an knowledge about it, but we cannot go into details about it.",

    "summary": "This transcript covers a press conference with an ambassador discussing several key international topics.  The first centers around a US Congressman's nomination of President Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, which the ambassador supports. The second involves the current situation in Gaza, with the ambassador expressing support for a ceasefire and indicating renewed negotiations are hoped for. Finally, questions arise concerning the recent military actions and their aftermath, specifically regarding diplomatic talks between Iran and Israel. The ambassador explains the necessity of military action due to diplomatic failures and stresses the early stage of the assessment of its effects on Iran's programs.  A UN Security Council resolution is deemed unnecessary at this point, given the acceptance of President Trump's proposal by both parties.  While acknowledging the removal of an imminent threat, the ambassador remains cautious about offering specific details.",
