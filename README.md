## Why Build This?

**Problem:** Processing video content manually takes hours.  
- Watch video, take notes: 1-2 hours
- Find key quotes, identify speakers: 30-60 minutes  
- Create clips for social media: 30-60 minutes
- Total: 2-4 hours per video

**Solution:** Station10.media does it in 5-10 minutes.
- Upload video
- Get transcript with speakers
- Get AI-selected clips ready to share
- Get entity intelligence with relationships

**ROI:** 35:1 time savings ($107 value at $60/hour vs $3 cost)

---

## Differentiation

**vs Competitors:**
- **Descript** ($24/mo): Transcription + editing, NO speaker intelligence, NO auto-clips
- **Opus Clip** ($29/mo): Auto-clips only, NO transcription, NO entities
- **Fireflies** ($29/mo): Basic entities, NO clips, generic speakers

**Station10.media:** All features + speaker-entity attribution + multi-objective clip AI + uncensored

**Pricing:** $149/mo Pro tier vs $82/mo for 3 separate inferior tools
