## Executive Summary

A former Tier 1 operator and selection instructor explains the fundamental differences between Tier 1 and Tier 2 special operations units. The primary distinction lies in their selection processes: Tier 2 selections are high-stress, team-oriented events designed to mentally break candidates, whereas Tier 1 selections are individual-focused assessments with neutral feedback. The brief identifies key units in each tier, such as Delta Force and SEAL Team 6 (Tier 1) versus Rangers and Special Forces (Tier 2), and decodes common colloquialisms like 'black SOF' (Tier 1), 'white SOF' (Tier 2), and the task force color codes used for identification.
