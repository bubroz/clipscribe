    "The primary difference between Tier 1 and Tier 2 selections is the methodology: Tier 2 selections use high-stress, team-based events with negative reinforcement, while Tier 1 selections are almost entirely individual events with no positive or negative feedback.",
    "The three main operational Tier 1 units are Delta Force, DEVGRU (SEAL Team 6), and the Intelligence Support Activity.",
    "Tier 2 units, also known as 'white SOF', include Rangers, Special Forces, MARSOC Raiders, Marine Force Recon, and most SEAL teams (excluding SEAL Team 6).",
    "Tier 1 units use task force color codes for identification: Delta Force is Green, SEAL Team 6 is Blue, and the Intelligence Support Activity is Orange (TFO).",
    "SEAL Team 6 is a distinct Tier 1 organization, significantly larger in personnel and support staff than other 'white side' or 'vanilla' SEAL teams."
