    "summary": "Cynthia Gonzalez, vice mayor of Cudahy (a small city in Los Angeles), publicly criticized the notorious Latino gangs Florencia and 18th Street on Instagram for their inaction in protecting their territory.  She highlights their failure to respond to what she describes as an invasion of their turf, specifically mentioning locations like 82nd Street and Co danza where the gangs are known for their territorial markings.  Her statement implies a lack of responsibility on the part of these gangs in maintaining control over their claimed areas.  The criticism is notable for its direct call for the gangs to fulfill a role typically associated with law enforcement, highlighting a complex dynamic of community expectations and gang activity within the city.",
