The CFO said they're planning strategic price increases to mitigate uh the effects of tariffs. And then you got the shares of DocuSign sharply lower. Earnings and revenue beat estimates, but billings in the first quarter uh came in weaker than expected. Um, the guidance That's a big move too. Yeah, the company's guidance for billing in the current quarter also came in below estimates. Broadcom earnings and revenue came in slightly higher than analysts expected and current quarter guidance also beat estimates on strong AI uh revenue growth. Uh, but the stock's pulling back a bit after a strong run up since the recent uh low hit in early April, just after President Trump announced uh the sweeping tariff plan. Stock's up about 70% from the April. There were some concerns from the Broadcom call yesterday that maybe all of this AI growth is not going to be quite as strong as had been hoped for, had been anticipated. That's what they said.",

    "summary": "Today's pre-opening market analysis highlights key economic data and corporate earnings. On Jobs Friday, forecasters anticipate a 125,000 increase in non-farm payrolls for May, with the unemployment rate expected to hold steady. This follows earlier weak indicators from ADP, jobless claims, and JOLTS data, setting a cautious tone for the labor market report.\n\nCompany-specific news reveals significant stock movements. Circle, a stablecoin company, saw its shares surge dramatically in pre-market trading, climbing to $94 after opening at $69, marking a 13% increase today. In contrast, Lulu Lemon's shares faced pressure despite revenue beating estimates, as its 1% comparable sales growth missed the 3% target. The company subsequently cut its full-year guidance, attributing the revision to a dynamic macro environment, and indicated plans for strategic price increases to offset tariff impacts.\n\nDocuSign also experienced a sharp decline in its shares, as weaker-than-expected first-quarter billings and below-estimate current quarter guidance overshadowed stronger earnings and revenue. Conversely, Broadcom delivered positive news with earnings and revenue slightly exceeding analyst expectations and robust current quarter guidance driven by strong AI revenue growth. However, Broadcom's stock is pulling back after a substantial 70% rally since early April, a period that began after President Trump announced a sweeping tariff plan. Concerns were also voiced during Broadcom's recent earnings call regarding the sustainability of AI growth expectations.",
