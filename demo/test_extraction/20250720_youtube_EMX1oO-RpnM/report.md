## Executive Summary

Today's pre-opening market analysis highlights key economic data and corporate earnings. On Jobs Friday, forecasters anticipate a 125,000 increase in non-farm payrolls for May, with the unemployment rate expected to hold steady. This follows earlier weak indicators from ADP, jobless claims, and JOLTS data, setting a cautious tone for the labor market report.

Company-specific news reveals significant stock movements. Circle, a stablecoin company, saw its shares surge dramatically in pre-market trading, climbing to $94 after opening at $69, marking a 13% increase today. In contrast, Lulu Lemon's shares faced pressure despite revenue beating estimates, as its 1% comparable sales growth missed the 3% target. The company subsequently cut its full-year guidance, attributing the revision to a dynamic macro environment, and indicated plans for strategic price increases to offset tariff impacts.

DocuSign also experienced a sharp decline in its shares, as weaker-than-expected first-quarter billings and below-estimate current quarter guidance overshadowed stronger earnings and revenue. Conversely, Broadcom delivered positive news with earnings and revenue slightly exceeding analyst expectations and robust current quarter guidance driven by strong AI revenue growth. However, Broadcom's stock is pulling back after a substantial 70% rally since early April, a period that began after President Trump announced a sweeping tariff plan. Concerns were also voiced during Broadcom's recent earnings call regarding the sustainability of AI growth expectations.
