  "content": "Five things to know ahead of the opening bell today. We're set to get a look at the jobs picture for June at 8:15 Eastern time. ADP is going to be releasing its latest look at private sector hiring. Now, economists are expecting an addition of 120,000 jobs for last month. We're also standing by for second quarter delivery metrics that we're going to get from Tesla. Phil Labow will be bringing us those numbers as soon as they cross the wires. As of late last month, the consensus was 393,000 vehicles, uh, deliveries that would be and uh, that would be a drop of more than 11% versus the second quarter of last year. And shares of health insurer Centene losing about a quarter of their value in the pre-market. The company pulling its 2025 earnings guidance, exciting market trends that differed from its assumptions, other health insurance companies getting hit this morning as well. And we're watching shares of Madela owner Constellation Brands. Earnings and revenue for the most recent quarter missed estimates and that's on falling demand and higher prices they're talking about for aluminum cans because of tariffs. Despite that miss, the company sticking with its full year guidance. And then there's this, Netflix has held talks with Spotify about partnering on a number of projects related to music award shows and live concert series. That's according to a report in the Wall Street Journal that said that Netflix is also considering doing some big celebrity interviews and short turnaround documentaries.",
  "summary": "This market update provides five key insights for the opening bell. Firstly, upcoming jobs data for June from ADP is anticipated, with economists projecting an addition of 120,000 private sector jobs for the preceding month. Secondly, Tesla's second-quarter delivery metrics are highly awaited; industry consensus, as of late last month, pointed to 393,000 vehicle deliveries, which would represent an 11% decline compared to the second quarter of the previous year. Phil Labow is expected to release these figures.\n\nThirdly, health insurer Centene experienced a significant drop in its shares during pre-market trading, losing approximately a quarter of its value. This downturn followed the company's decision to withdraw its 2025 earnings guidance, citing market trends that diverged from its initial assumptions. Other health insurance companies also faced negative impacts this morning.\n\nFourthly, Constellation Brands, the owner of Madela, reported earnings and revenue for its most recent quarter that fell short of estimates. This miss was attributed to a combination of falling consumer demand and increased prices for aluminum cans, the latter being a consequence of tariffs. Despite these disappointing results, Constellation Brands confirmed it would maintain its full-year guidance. Finally, Netflix is reportedly in discussions with Spotify regarding potential partnerships on various projects, including music award shows and live concert series. This information comes from a Wall Street Journal report, which also indicated that Netflix is exploring opportunities for major celebrity interviews and quick-turnaround documentaries.",
