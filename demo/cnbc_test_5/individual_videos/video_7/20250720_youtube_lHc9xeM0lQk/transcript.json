    "summary": "This market update provides five key insights for the opening bell. Firstly, upcoming jobs data for June from ADP is anticipated, with economists projecting an addition of 120,000 private sector jobs for the preceding month. Secondly, Tesla's second-quarter delivery metrics are highly awaited; industry consensus, as of late last month, pointed to 393,000 vehicle deliveries, which would represent an 11% decline compared to the second quarter of the previous year. Phil Labow is expected to release these figures.\n\nThirdly, health insurer Centene experienced a significant drop in its shares during pre-market trading, losing approximately a quarter of its value. This downturn followed the company's decision to withdraw its 2025 earnings guidance, citing market trends that diverged from its initial assumptions. Other health insurance companies also faced negative impacts this morning.\n\nFourthly, Constellation Brands, the owner of Madela, reported earnings and revenue for its most recent quarter that fell short of estimates. This miss was attributed to a combination of falling consumer demand and increased prices for aluminum cans, the latter being a consequence of tariffs. Despite these disappointing results, Constellation Brands confirmed it would maintain its full-year guidance. Finally, Netflix is reportedly in discussions with Spotify regarding potential partnerships on various projects, including music award shows and live concert series. This information comes from a Wall Street Journal report, which also indicated that Netflix is exploring opportunities for major celebrity interviews and quick-turnaround documentaries.",
