That's in Arizona and they're going to be trying to build robots and artificial intelligence there. That's according to a Bloomberg report. Meantime, Microsoft considering halting negotiations with Open AI about the future of their partnership. That's if the two sides can't agree on some key issues like the size of Microsoft's future stake in Open AI. and that's from the Financial Times. Meantime, a report saying Microsoft now planning to cut several thousand jobs. That's just going to be in the next several weeks in sales and some other teams. And a SpaceX Starship rocket exploded at the Starbase facility in Texas. That happened on Wednesday during a routine testing in preparation for a launch on social media. SpaceX described it as a major anomaly and said all personnel are safe and accounted for. Elon Musk also responding on his platform X writing quote, just a scratch. Just a scratch. That's funny. Well, not funny but uh when you look at that.",
  "summary": "This broadcast from Squad Box 5 provides an overview of various significant developments across geopolitics, technology, and business ahead of the day's opening bell. Geopolitically, President Trump is expected to decide within the next two weeks whether the United States will intervene in the Middle East conflict. Concurrently, Iran's foreign minister is scheduled to meet with his counterparts from Britain, France, and Germany in Switzerland today to discuss international matters. In the technology sector, Softbank is reportedly in talks with Taiwan Semiconductor to collaborate on building a trillion-dollar industrial complex in Arizona. This ambitious project aims to focus on the development of robots and artificial intelligence, according to a Bloomberg report. Meanwhile, Microsoft is said to be considering pausing its negotiations with OpenAI due to unresolved disagreements concerning key issues, specifically the size of Microsoft's future stake in the AI company, as reported by the Financial Times. Further news regarding Microsoft indicates that the company plans to implement several thousand job cuts across its sales and other teams within the coming weeks. Additionally, a recent incident involved a SpaceX Starship rocket, which exploded during routine testing at the Starbase facility in Texas on Wednesday. While SpaceX characterized the event as a 'major anomaly' on social media, they confirmed that all personnel remained safe. Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX, downplayed the incident on his platform X, humorously remarking, 'just a scratch.'",
