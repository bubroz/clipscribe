## Executive Summary

The market outlook ahead of the opening bell highlights key developments in international trade and domestic policy. President Trump's top trade officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and US Trade Representative Jameson Greer, are currently in London meeting with Chinese counterparts. These discussions follow recent data from China indicating a significant 34.5% drop in exports to the US in May and a fourth consecutive month of decline in China's Consumer Price Index (CPI), raising concerns about domestic prices.

Simultaneously, a US trade team in India has extended its negotiations, originally scheduled for last Thursday and Friday, through Tuesday. This extension, reported by Bloomberg, suggests positive progress in the talks. Domestically, President Trump confirmed an imminent announcement for his next Fed chair pick, hinting at former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh as a highly regarded candidate, despite Warsh's potentially more hawkish stance compared to current Fed Chair Jay Powell.

In collegiate sports, a landmark federal judge's approval of a $2.6 billion settlement late Friday will enable direct payments from universities to athletes. This decision allows Division I schools to distribute approximately $20 million annually to their athletes, ushering in a new era for college sports. While it promises to channel billions into revenue-generating sports like football and basketball, there's concern it could jeopardize funding for non-revenue sports, particularly at smaller institutions. The discussion also touched upon the timing of the Fed chair announcement, noting Jay Powell's term extends until May 2026.
