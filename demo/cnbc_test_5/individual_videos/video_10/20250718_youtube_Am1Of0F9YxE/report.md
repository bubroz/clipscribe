## Executive Summary

This report outlines five significant developments across finance, technology, media, and celebrity news. In the economic sphere, markets anticipate the release of core PCE data, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, which economists project to show a 2.6% year-over-year increase, a slight uptick from April's figures. This data is expected at 8:30 Eastern time, setting the tone for the opening bell.

Corporate news features major changes at Tesla, where CEO Elon Musk has reportedly fired the vice president of manufacturing operations, a detail gleaned from internal organizational charts viewed by CNBC. The media landscape also sees shifts, with the American edition of Vogue Magazine seeking a new head of editorial content. This role was previously held for decades by Anna Wintour, who will transition to chief content officer at Condé Nast and global editorial director at Vogue. Additionally, Uber is in discussions with co-founder Travis Kalanick regarding potential funding for his acquisition of the U.S. subsidiary of Chinese company Pony AI, as reported by the New York Times.

Finally, the report highlights a high-profile celebrity event: Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and his fiancée Lauren Sanchez have arrived in Venice, Italy, for their extravagant wedding, rumored to cost over 50 million euros/dollars. The couple, observed leaving the luxury Aman Hotel with extensive security, is expected to marry 'today' on the picturesque island of San Giorgio, located directly opposite St. Mark's. The event is anticipated to be a 'big wedding weekend' with approximately 200 confirmed guests, including renowned figures such as Mick Jagger, Ivanka Trump (with her husband Jared), Oprah Winfrey, and Bill Gates.
