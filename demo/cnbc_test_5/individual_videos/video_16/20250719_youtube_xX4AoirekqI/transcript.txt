Five things to know ahead of today's opening bell. Israel striking Iran's nuclear infrastructure in a wave of attacks that Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard Corps said killed its top commander. Uh, Israel working to bring down drones that Iran launched in retaliation. Iran saying a key nuclear enrichment site was damaged, but that no radiation contamination has occurred. Investigators are searching the site of the airliner crash in Western India for evidence and missing people. Local media said one of the two black boxes from the Boeing 787 Dreamliner had been recovered, though that hasn't been confirmed. One passenger actually survived that crash. A federal appeals court ruling the Trump administration can maintain control of several thousand national guard troops in California and continue deploying them in Los Angeles. That order coming shortly after a lower court said that the National Guard deployment was illegal. The White House moved to deploy troops in response to protests over its immigration crackdown. And the house narrowly voting in favor of a proposal to cancel more than $9 billion in previously approved federal funding. More than $8 billion of that was earmarked for foreign aid. About a billion dollars was meant for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds PBS and NPR. And the New York Times reports that a group of venture capital firms are planning to buy about $250 million worth of shares of Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company, XAI. Documents seen by the paper say that employees could sell some of their shares in a tender offer that values XAI at about $113 billion.
