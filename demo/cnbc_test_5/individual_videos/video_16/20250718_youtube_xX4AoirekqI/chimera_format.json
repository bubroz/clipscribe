  "content": "Five things to know ahead of today's opening bell. Israel striking Iran's nuclear infrastructure in a wave of attacks that Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard Corps said killed its top commander. Uh, Israel working to bring down drones that Iran launched in retaliation. Iran saying a key nuclear enrichment site was damaged, but that no radiation contamination has occurred. Investigators are searching the site of the airliner crash in Western India for evidence and missing people. Local media said one of the two black boxes from the Boeing 787 Dreamliner had been recovered, though that hasn't been confirmed. One passenger actually survived that crash. A federal appeals court ruling the Trump administration can maintain control of several thousand national guard troops in California and continue deploying them in Los Angeles. That order coming shortly after a lower court said that the National Guard deployment was illegal. The White House moved to deploy troops in response to protests over its immigration crackdown. And the house narrowly voting in favor of a proposal to cancel more than $9 billion in previously approved federal funding. More than $8 billion of that was earmarked for foreign aid. About a billion dollars was meant for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds PBS and NPR. And the New York Times reports that a group of venture capital firms are planning to buy about $250 million worth of shares of Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company, XAI. Documents seen by the paper say that employees could sell some of their shares in a tender offer that values XAI at about $113 billion.",
  "summary": "Today's financial opening bell is preceded by several significant global events. In the Middle East, Israel has launched a series of strikes against Iran's nuclear infrastructure, which Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard Corps claims resulted in the death of its top commander. In response, Iran launched drones, which Israel is working to neutralize. Iran has confirmed damage to a key nuclear enrichment site but asserts no radiation contamination has occurred.\\n\\nSimultaneously, an investigation is underway in Western India following an airliner crash. While local media reports indicate that one of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner's black boxes has been recovered, this remains unconfirmed. Notably, one passenger miraculously survived the crash.\\n\\nDomestically, a federal appeals court has ruled in favor of the Trump administration, allowing it to maintain control and deployment of thousands of National Guard troops in California, specifically in Los Angeles. This ruling overturns a lower court's decision that had deemed the National Guard deployment illegal, a measure taken by the White House in response to immigration-related protests. Furthermore, the House of Representatives has narrowly passed a proposal to cancel over $9 billion in approved federal funding, with more than $8 billion allocated for foreign aid and approximately $1 billion intended for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports PBS and NPR.\\n\\nIn the tech sector, The New York Times reports that a consortium of venture capital firms intends to acquire approximately $250 million worth of shares in Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company, XAI. Documents reviewed by the newspaper reveal that employees will have the opportunity to sell some of their shares in a tender offer, valuing XAI at an estimated $113 billion.",
