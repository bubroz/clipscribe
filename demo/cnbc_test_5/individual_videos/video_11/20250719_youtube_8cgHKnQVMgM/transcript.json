    "full_text": "Five things to know ahead of today's opening bell. Treasury Secretary Scott Bassant says that he believes the Senate is on track for a vote this Friday on President Trump's tax and spending bill. Yesterday Bassant also predicted House and Senate Republicans would reach a deal on the salt deduction cap somewhere in the next 24 to 48 hours. Reports say Polymarket is close to raising $200 million in a funding round that would value the prediction market company at about a billion dollars. An investment platform is launching new digital tokens that use blockchain technology to mirror the performance of the private shares of SpaceX. That's according to a Wall Street Journal report that says the platform called Republic is using the strategy to give investors access to companies typically reserved for the wealthy. The method hasn't been tested with regulators yet. And chip design firm Ambrella coming off more than 20% stock gain yesterday. A report says that the company is working with bankers on a potential sale. Also, speaking of chips, Micron Technologies quarterly results are due after today's closing bell. Those shares have roughly doubled since the S&P 500's April low. Investors will be looking for insight on Micron's ability to meet the surge and demand for high bandwidth memory chips for AI applications. And by the way, all of these chip stocks have done this too. Nvidia is up 40% just in the last two months.",

    "summary": "This market update provides five key insights ahead of the opening bell, covering legislative, corporate, and tech sector news. Treasury Secretary Scott Bassant indicated that the Senate is set to vote this Friday on President Trump's tax and spending bill. Furthermore, Bassant predicted that House and Senate Republicans are nearing a deal on the salt deduction cap, expected within the next 24 to 48 hours.\n\nIn corporate finance, Polymarket is reportedly close to securing $200 million in a funding round, which would elevate its valuation to approximately one billion dollars. Concurrently, an investment platform named Republic is launching innovative digital tokens. These tokens, leveraging blockchain technology, are designed to mirror the performance of private shares in companies like SpaceX, aiming to democratize access for investors typically excluded from such opportunities, although this method has yet to be vetted by regulators.\n\nFinally, the chip sector is under the spotlight, with Ambrella, a chip design firm, experiencing a notable stock gain of over 20% yesterday amid reports of a potential sale involving bankers. Micron Technologies' quarterly results are anticipated after today's closing bell, with investors closely watching for insights into its capacity to meet the surging demand for high bandwidth memory chips crucial for AI applications. The broader chip market is also thriving, highlighted by Nvidia's shares soaring 40% in just the last two months, underscoring a robust trend across the sector since the S&P 500's April low.",
