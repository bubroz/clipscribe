In a letter to Prime Minister Mark Carney posted on Truth Social, Trump attributed Fentanyl as the reason for the higher rate. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with China's Foreign Minister in Malaysia today. It's their first in-person meeting as trade tensions between the two countries continue. After the meeting, Rubio said a summit between President Trump and Xi is likely. And Google has reportedly reached a deal to provide cloud computing services for the US government at a heavily discounted price. The Financial Times reports the deal could be finalized within weeks. Oracle cut a similar deal last week. Apple is planning a slate of new product releases for the first half of 2026 including a new low-end iPhone, multiple iPads, and upgraded Mac computers. That's according to a Bloomberg report citing people familiar with Apple's plans. And Flutter Entertainment has reached a deal to take full ownership of sports betting platform FanDuel. It's buying Boyd Gaming's 5% stake in the company for $1.76 billion. The deal values FanDuel at $31 billion. Flutter says FanDuel holds 43% of the sports betting market. So, there's no, uh,",

    "summary": "The broadcast provides an overview of several key business and political developments. President Trump has announced new 35% tariffs on imports from Canada, effective August 1st, citing Fentanyl as the reason in a letter to Prime Minister Mark Carney posted on Truth Social. This move signals a significant shift in trade relations with Canada.\n\nIn international diplomacy, Secretary of State Marco Rubio held his first in-person meeting with China's Foreign Minister in Malaysia, amidst ongoing trade tensions. Following the discussion, Rubio suggested that a summit between President Trump and Chinese leader Xi is a likely next step. Domestically, Google is reportedly close to finalizing a deal to provide cloud computing services to the US government at a heavily discounted rate, a week after Oracle secured a similar agreement.\n\nLooking ahead, Apple is preparing for a major product launch in the first half of 2026, which is expected to include a new low-end iPhone, several iPads, and updated Mac computers, according to a Bloomberg report. Finally, in the sports betting industry, Flutter Entertainment is set to gain full ownership of FanDuel by acquiring Boyd Gaming's remaining 5% stake for $1.76 billion, valuing FanDuel at an impressive $31 billion. Flutter highlights FanDuel's dominant position, holding 43% of the sports betting market.",
