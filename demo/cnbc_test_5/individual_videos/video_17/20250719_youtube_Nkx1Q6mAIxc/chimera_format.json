  "content": "Five things to know ahead of today's opening bell. Elon Musk walking back his criticism of President Trump in a post on X just after 3:00 a.m. Eastern time, he wrote, I regret some of my posts about President Trump last week. They went too far. Still up or like us um awake. Hard to know with him. With President Trump, I would say waking up early. With Elon Musk, I think he's probably. Oh, that was my point. Yeah. I think he's still up. Don't you think? Probably. Probably. I don't know him well enough to know his. Maybe he doesn't sleep at all. My guess is, yeah, he doesn't have a normal. Although, I I take that back. He had said at one point that he was he had said at one point that he wants to get at least six hours of sleep because he tried less than that and it was sub-optimal. He did. Sleep under desk at his factories. But he he has made some comments about how. If sleep does anything for synapses or neurotransmitters, uh he needs to No, he especially and he needs to sleep. His are firing pretty rapidly. Separately, Elon Musk said that Tesla's Robo taxi service is tentatively set to launch in Austin, Texas on June 22nd, but he said they are being super paranoid in his words about safety so that they could ship. And US and China negotiators say that they have reached an agreement to get the Geneva consensus back on track. The deal reached in Geneva back in May included the suspension of some tariffs and easing of key export restrictions, but the United States and China had accused each other of cheating since then. And a federal appeals court saying it will allow President Trump's sweeping tariffs to remain in effect while it reviews a lower court decision that blocked them. That lower court had ruled that the president exceeded the authority of the Emergency Economic Powers Act that was used to justify the tariffs. Arguments are scheduled for July 31st. And Treasury Secretary Scott Bezant is a contender to be the next Fed chair. That's according to a Bloomberg report that says advisors inside and outside the administration have been recommending him for the job. But the White House called that report fake news. Fake news.",
  "summary": "The report highlights five key developments ahead of today's opening bell. Firstly, Elon Musk publicly expressed regret for his recent criticisms of President Trump on X, acknowledging that his posts last week 'went too far'. This apology was made in the early hours, sparking discussion about Musk's unusual sleep habits, despite his past statements about aiming for at least six hours of sleep for optimal performance. \n\nSecondly, Elon Musk also announced that Tesla's highly anticipated Robo taxi service is tentatively scheduled to launch in Austin, Texas, on June 22nd. Musk emphasized the company's extreme caution regarding safety, indicating a meticulous approach before deployment. This news follows a period of anticipation for Tesla's autonomous driving solutions. \n\nThirdly, negotiators from the United States and China have reportedly reached an agreement aimed at reactivating the Geneva consensus. This original deal, established in May, involved measures such as suspending certain tariffs and easing key export restrictions between the two economic powers. However, the agreement's progress has been complicated by mutual accusations of non-compliance and cheating since its initial signing. \n\nFourth, a federal appeals court has ruled to keep President Trump's sweeping tariffs in effect while it reviews a lower court's decision that had previously blocked them. The lower court's ruling contended that President Trump had exceeded his authority under the Emergency Economic Powers Act, which was cited to justify the tariffs. Oral arguments for this significant review are slated for July 31st. Finally, Treasury Secretary Scott Bezant was identified as a potential candidate for the next Fed chair by a Bloomberg report, with advisors reportedly recommending him for the position. However, the White House promptly dismissed this report as 'fake news'.",
