Don't you think? Probably. Probably. I don't know him well enough to know his. Maybe he doesn't sleep at all. My guess is, yeah, he doesn't have a normal. Although, I I take that back. He had said at one point that he was he had said at one point that he wants to get at least six hours of sleep because he tried less than that and it was sub-optimal. He did.

Separately, Elon Musk said that Tesla's Robo taxi service is tentatively set to launch in Austin, Texas on June 22nd, but he said they are being super paranoid in his words about safety so that they could ship.

That lower court had ruled that the president exceeded the authority of the Emergency Economic Powers Act that was used to justify the tariffs. Arguments are scheduled for July 31st. And Treasury Secretary Scott Bezant is a contender to be the next Fed chair.

    "summary": "The report highlights five key developments ahead of today's opening bell. Firstly, Elon Musk publicly expressed regret for his recent criticisms of President Trump on X, acknowledging that his posts last week 'went too far'. This apology was made in the early hours, sparking discussion about Musk's unusual sleep habits, despite his past statements about aiming for at least six hours of sleep for optimal performance. \n\nSecondly, Elon Musk also announced that Tesla's highly anticipated Robo taxi service is tentatively scheduled to launch in Austin, Texas, on June 22nd. Musk emphasized the company's extreme caution regarding safety, indicating a meticulous approach before deployment. This news follows a period of anticipation for Tesla's autonomous driving solutions. \n\nThirdly, negotiators from the United States and China have reportedly reached an agreement aimed at reactivating the Geneva consensus. This original deal, established in May, involved measures such as suspending certain tariffs and easing key export restrictions between the two economic powers. However, the agreement's progress has been complicated by mutual accusations of non-compliance and cheating since its initial signing. \n\nFourth, a federal appeals court has ruled to keep President Trump's sweeping tariffs in effect while it reviews a lower court's decision that had previously blocked them. The lower court's ruling contended that President Trump had exceeded his authority under the Emergency Economic Powers Act, which was cited to justify the tariffs. Oral arguments for this significant review are slated for July 31st. Finally, Treasury Secretary Scott Bezant was identified as a potential candidate for the next Fed chair by a Bloomberg report, with advisors reportedly recommending him for the position. However, the White House promptly dismissed this report as 'fake news'.",
