  "content": "Five things to know ahead of today's opening bell. Recapping the breaking news from Becky at the top of the show, Chevron has prevailed in its mediation with Exxon over the Guyana oil assets. The decision clears the way for Chevron's acquisition of Hess. A look at Hess stock up 8 and a half% premarket, Chevron up 3.7%. Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell formerly responding to questions from the White House about renovations to the Central Bank's DC headquarters. In a letter to the Office of Management and Budget, Powell provided details on project cost overruns. He's also batted down accusations that the renovated buildings will feature luxury amenities. The Financial Times reporting the valuation of AI startup Perplexity has risen 18 to $18 billion, two months after the company raised money at a $14 billion valuation. The paper says that after funding round closed, uh new investors approached Perplexity and were told they could purchase equity at the higher valuation level. And Amazon is laying off some staffers in its cloud computing division. A spokesperson said the cuts were not primarily due to investments in AI, but are a result of ongoing efforts to streamline the workforce and refocus on certain priorities. And the Commerce Department says it will impose anti-dumping duties of more than 90% on a type of graphite imported from China and used in making electric vehicle batteries. The government concluding the material is being sold in the US at less than fair market value.",
  "summary": "The day's market opened with significant corporate and economic news. Chevron announced its success in mediation with Exxon concerning the highly contested Guyana oil assets, a resolution that clears the path for Chevron's planned acquisition of Hess. Following this news, Hess's stock saw a substantial premarket surge of 8.5%, while Chevron also experienced a positive uplift of 3.7%, indicating positive investor reception to the strategic development in the energy sector.\n\nFurther economic updates included Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell's formal response to inquiries from the White House regarding the extensive renovations at the Central Bank's Washington D.C. headquarters. In a detailed letter to the Office of Management and Budget, Powell addressed concerns over project cost overruns. He also explicitly refuted allegations that the renovated facilities would incorporate luxury amenities, providing transparency on the expenditures.\n\nIn the tech sector, AI startup Perplexity's valuation remarkably jumped to $18 billion, a significant increase from its $14 billion valuation just two months prior. This rapid ascent occurred after its last funding round closed, attracting new investors willing to acquire equity at the higher valuation. Separately, Amazon announced layoffs within its cloud computing division. A company spokesperson clarified that these job cuts were primarily driven by efforts to streamline the workforce and refocus strategic priorities, rather than being a direct consequence of investments in artificial intelligence. Finally, the Commerce Department revealed its intent to impose anti-dumping duties exceeding 90% on graphite imported from China, a crucial material for electric vehicle batteries, after determining it was being sold in the U.S. below fair market value.",
