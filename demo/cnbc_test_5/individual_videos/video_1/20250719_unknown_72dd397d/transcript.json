    "summary": "The day's market opened with significant corporate and economic news. Chevron announced its success in mediation with Exxon concerning the highly contested Guyana oil assets, a resolution that clears the path for Chevron's planned acquisition of Hess. Following this news, Hess's stock saw a substantial premarket surge of 8.5%, while Chevron also experienced a positive uplift of 3.7%, indicating positive investor reception to the strategic development in the energy sector.\n\nFurther economic updates included Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell's formal response to inquiries from the White House regarding the extensive renovations at the Central Bank's Washington D.C. headquarters. In a detailed letter to the Office of Management and Budget, Powell addressed concerns over project cost overruns. He also explicitly refuted allegations that the renovated facilities would incorporate luxury amenities, providing transparency on the expenditures.\n\nIn the tech sector, AI startup Perplexity's valuation remarkably jumped to $18 billion, a significant increase from its $14 billion valuation just two months prior. This rapid ascent occurred after its last funding round closed, attracting new investors willing to acquire equity at the higher valuation. Separately, Amazon announced layoffs within its cloud computing division. A company spokesperson clarified that these job cuts were primarily driven by efforts to streamline the workforce and refocus strategic priorities, rather than being a direct consequence of investments in artificial intelligence. Finally, the Commerce Department revealed its intent to impose anti-dumping duties exceeding 90% on graphite imported from China, a crucial material for electric vehicle batteries, after determining it was being sold in the U.S. below fair market value.",
