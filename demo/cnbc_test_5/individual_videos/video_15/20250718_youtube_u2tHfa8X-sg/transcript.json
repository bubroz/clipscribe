    "full_text": "All right, five things to know ahead of today's opening bell. Israel's military says that it has achieved aerial superiority over Iran's capital, Tehran. It's the fourth day of fighting between the two countries since Israel launched attacks on Iran's nuclear infrastructure. US Ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee said that the US Embassy branch in Tel Aviv sustained minor damage from shockwaves from a nearby explosion, but no US personnel were injured.\n\nPresident Trump has approved Nippon Steel's nearly $15 billion dollar bid for US Steel after 18 months of twists and turns. That deal includes $11 billion in new investments by the year 2028. It will boost Nippon's annual production capacity to 86 million metric tons of steel. That is up from 63 million tons. And shares of French fashion house, Kering are up sharply in European trading. That follows reports that the company has appointed Renault CEO Luca de Meo as its next CEO. Kering has not confirmed that report, but Renault said yesterday that de Meo was stepping down to take on challenges outside the automotive sector.\n\nTaiwan's Commerce Ministry adding Chinese chip makers Huawei and SMIC to its export control list. That means Taiwanese companies will have to obtain permits before selling products to the Chinese companies. And a cyber attack on the Washington Post compromised the email accounts of several journalists, including those on the national security and economic policy teams. In an internal memo yesterday, the paper's executive editor notified staff about the intrusion into its email system. The paper believes a foreign government could be responsible for that attack.",

    "summary": "The report highlights five significant global developments impacting markets. Firstly, in the Middle East, Israel's military has declared aerial superiority over Iran's capital, Tehran, marking the fourth consecutive day of conflict stemming from Israel's initial attacks on Iran's nuclear infrastructure. Concurrently, the US Embassy branch in Tel Aviv sustained minor damage from nearby explosion shockwaves, though no American personnel were harmed, as confirmed by US Ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee.\n\nEconomically, a major business deal sees President Trump's approval of Nippon Steel's roughly $15 billion acquisition of US Steel, a culmination of an 18-month negotiation. This deal includes a substantial $11 billion in new investments by Nippon Steel slated for completion by 2028, and is projected to significantly boost Nippon's annual steel production capacity from 63 million to 86 million metric tons. In the fashion sector, Kering's shares surged in Europe amid reports of Luca de Meo, current Renault CEO, being appointed as Kering's new CEO, although Kering has not verified this, Renault confirmed de Meo's departure to pursue opportunities outside the automotive industry.\n\nIn technology and cybersecurity news, Taiwan's Commerce Ministry has imposed stricter export controls by adding Chinese chipmakers Huawei and SMIC to its restricted list, necessitating permits for Taiwanese companies to sell products to them. Lastly, a cyber attack targeting the Washington Post compromised email accounts of several journalists, particularly those on the national security and economic policy teams. The paper's executive editor informed staff about the intrusion, and the Washington Post suspects a foreign government's involvement in the attack.",
