## Executive Summary

The report highlights five significant global developments impacting markets. Firstly, in the Middle East, Israel's military has declared aerial superiority over Iran's capital, Tehran, marking the fourth consecutive day of conflict stemming from Israel's initial attacks on Iran's nuclear infrastructure. Concurrently, the US Embassy branch in Tel Aviv sustained minor damage from nearby explosion shockwaves, though no American personnel were harmed, as confirmed by US Ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee.

Economically, a major business deal sees President Trump's approval of Nippon Steel's roughly $15 billion acquisition of US Steel, a culmination of an 18-month negotiation. This deal includes a substantial $11 billion in new investments by Nippon Steel slated for completion by 2028, and is projected to significantly boost Nippon's annual steel production capacity from 63 million to 86 million metric tons. In the fashion sector, Kering's shares surged in Europe amid reports of Luca de Meo, current Renault CEO, being appointed as Kering's new CEO, although Kering has not verified this, Renault confirmed de Meo's departure to pursue opportunities outside the automotive industry.

In technology and cybersecurity news, Taiwan's Commerce Ministry has imposed stricter export controls by adding Chinese chipmakers Huawei and SMIC to its restricted list, necessitating permits for Taiwanese companies to sell products to them. Lastly, a cyber attack targeting the Washington Post compromised email accounts of several journalists, particularly those on the national security and economic policy teams. The paper's executive editor informed staff about the intrusion, and the Washington Post suspects a foreign government's involvement in the attack.
