    "full_text": "Welcome back to Squawk Box, five things to know ahead of today's opening bell. A source telling CNBC two federal investigations into online prediction betting site Polymarket have been closed with no charges filed against the company. The Justice Department and CFTC had been investigating whether Polymarket was accepting bets from people in the United States. Meanwhile, Republicans narrowly voting to advance a package of spending cuts proposed by President Trump. The procedural vote on that roughly $9 billion dollar package passed the Senate 51 to 50 with Vice President J.D. Vance breaking that tie. The measure seeks to claw back previously approved funding for foreign aid and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting with which funds PBS and NPR. And Elon Musk's company SpaceX planning an insider share sale that would value the company at roughly $400 billion. That's according to a Bloomberg report. And Tesla's top sales executive in North America has left the company. The Wall Street Journal reporting that Troy Jones, the company's vice president of sales, services delivery in the region, departing the company this after 15 years. He's the latest in a string of top executives to leave the company since April. And finally, a robot taking center stage in last night's Major League Baseball All-Star game, the ABS automated ball strike system coming into play in the first inning when catcher Cal Raleigh used it to challenge a call. He was right and it led to a strikeout. As CNBC's Alex Sherman reported yesterday, MLB Commissioner Rob uh Manfred supporting that new technology and it may be ready for every game next year. I'm all in favor of it. Instant replay, right? Instant replay. But then what was the thing that happened at Wimbledon this year where this AI system totally missed the call and then they didn't have a replay and who was it who lost the point and it like lost the whole match because of it. It was crazy. Oh. Umpires are I mean, tough job. Tough job. But I I've had, you know, now that I have sometimes I have some thing, you know, $5 or $10 on the line. There are times in an inning where one call if it's just egregious and totally obvious that it was bad. It's like that totally changed. It it hurts a rally or or it stops, you know, it can make a a difference. But then there's times when you need the the umpire instead of a machine. I I why? Why do you need the umpire? I'm trying to figure that out. Exactly because if the machine absolutely no, that's wrong. Like. Oh, the machine's wrong. That's bad. Obviously. I don't I don't know how I feel about that. Uh,",

    "summary": "The broadcast opens with a segment on five key updates, starting with the news that two federal investigations into the online prediction betting platform, Polymarket, conducted by the Justice Department and the CFTC, have been closed without any charges filed. These investigations primarily focused on whether Polymarket was accepting wagers from individuals within the United States. Following this, the report shifts to political developments, detailing how Republicans narrowly succeeded in advancing a $9 billion package of spending cuts. This procedural vote passed the Senate by a slim 51-50 margin, with Vice President J.D. Vance casting the decisive tie-breaking vote. The proposed measure aims to claw back previously approved funds allocated for foreign aid and for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which is responsible for funding public media outlets like PBS and NPR.\n\nIn corporate news, SpaceX, led by Elon Musk, is reportedly planning an insider share sale. This sale is expected to value the aerospace company at an estimated $400 billion, according to a Bloomberg report. Concurrently, Tesla has experienced another high-level executive departure, with Troy Jones, the Vice President of Sales, Services Delivery in North America, leaving the company after 15 years. This exit, reported by The Wall Street Journal, marks Troy Jones as the latest in a series of top executives to depart Tesla since April, indicating a trend of leadership changes within the electric vehicle manufacturer.\n\nThe broadcast concludes with a discussion on the integration of technology in sports, specifically highlighting the use of the ABS automated ball strike system during the recent Major League Baseball All-Star game. During the first inning, catcher Cal Raleigh utilized the system to successfully challenge a call, which ultimately led to a strikeout. CNBC's Alex Sherman reported yesterday that MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred supports this new technology, suggesting it could be implemented across all MLB games as early as next year. The segment then transitions into a broader debate among the hosts about the merits and drawbacks of automated officiating versus human umpires, citing a controversial incident at Wimbledon this year where an AI system's error significantly impacted a match.",
