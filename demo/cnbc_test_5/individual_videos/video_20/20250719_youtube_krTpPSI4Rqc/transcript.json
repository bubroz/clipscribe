    "summary": "Ahead of today's opening bell, several key developments are unfolding across different sectors. In politics, lawmakers are back at work this week, with the Senate prepared to take up the reconciliation bill. Republican Senator Ron Johnson is advocating for more significant spending cuts to address the national debt. Concurrently, the Trump administration's cost-cutting initiatives have expanded beyond consulting firms to include technology companies; the Wall Street Journal reports that ten tech firms, including Dell and CDW, received letters last week requesting justification for their work and identification of potential cuts.\n\nOn the international stage, Ukraine has claimed responsibility for a clandestine drone attack that reportedly destroyed numerous Russian warplanes, specifically targeting Russia's long-range bomber fleet. This significant event precedes a crucial meeting scheduled for today in Istanbul, where delegations from Russia and Ukraine are set to engage in negotiations for a ceasefire.\n\nDomestically, a New York Airport is preparing to reopen a previously closed runway today. The closure of this runway had contributed to weeks of significant delays and operational disruptions. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the completed repairs, deeming the runway safe for use, and notably, the work was completed thirteen days ahead of its projected schedule.\n\nFinally, in entertainment news, Disney's 'Lilo and Stitch' performed well at the weekend box office, grossing $63 million. This performance positions it as the second highest-grossing movie of the year, trailing only the 'Minecraft movie.' 'Lilo and Stitch' has accumulated $280 million in ticket sales across the US and Canada to date.",
