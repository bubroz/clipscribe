And Speaker of the House Mike Johnson still isn't ready to negotiate. Take a look.",1.0
116.764,137.346,SPEAKER_00,"If Democrats keep up their instruction here today, This is where we're going to be headed. We're barreling toward one of the longest shutdowns in American history unless Democrats drop their partisan demands and passed a clean, no-strings-attached budget to reopen the government and pay our federal workers. We will not allow the American people to be taken hostage over partisan demands.",1.0
137.579,162.665,SPEAKER_02,"OK, Mike, the Democrats sticking point is keeping health care safe for millions of Americans. So who exactly is holding who hostage here and who is going to step up and make a deal? I mean, we know that you can do it. You're touting this deal that you did and you brought peace. Now, what are you going to do? What are you going to do, Mike?",1.0
162.685,214.831,SPEAKER_11,"Well, the speaker is calling it partisan demands. But the important thing to note is 80 percent of all ACA premium tax credits went to enrollees in Trump won states. That's 80 percent. For the Affordable Care Act. For the Affordable Care Act, yes. So the thing that Democrats are fighting for right now. But also 78% of adults say Congress should extend these tax credits, and that's across the boards. 92% Democrats, 82% Independents, 59% Republicans, 57% of those 59 align with MAGA. If it's partisan, it's partisan to the right, and it is about the people here, but I also think we're paying Congress to make a deal. It's not about running to your corners. Anyone that's ever had to get along with someone means you concede something. I don't like that they're at recess right now and they're not sitting around saying, okay, well, we're gonna separate this bill out and here's what it's gonna look like. They're doing nothing.",1.0

243.856,251.197,SPEAKER_11,"It still has to pass the Senate, though. That could be the thing that brings the whole thing down. But it opens up the vote, the transparency of the vote. Yes. And puts people on the record.",1.0
251.217,314.839,SPEAKER_05,"So listen. I'm I remain with the 34 percent of Americans who think Congress in general deserves blame that the government is shut down. And I worry a little bit about the optics here. So a lot of folks feel like the presidency is too powerful. Donald Trump does kind of appear all powerful right now. I think a lot of folks feel that way. And in this moment, Congress being shut down, I don't think is giving people a lot of hope that we've got co-equal branches of government. So right now, the White House has found ways to maneuver around Congress during this government shutdown. You've seen Donald Trump in Israel, in Egypt, back in America. You've seen the White House extend WIC benefits by using tariff revenue because those were stopped due to the shutdown. Trump's now directed the Pentagon to pay troops because Congress is not passing this bill that will pay our troops. And he's also directing the Office of Management and Budget to look at ways to pay law enforcement. The only step I see left is for the White House to be like, and by executive order, we're going to extend these Obamacare subsidies. So I would caution Congress, if you guys don't step up and reclaim your power, you've ceded it all to the White House that at least half of you are claiming you want to stop.",1.0
314.859,348.665,SPEAKER_03,"That's a good point. You know, you mentioned Marjorie Taylor Greene. Yes. I'm getting worried that she and I agree on stuff now. Yes, that's why I thought you were talking about her. No, I mean, she has said that Republican men are weak and they're afraid of strong Republican women. She's got it over here for Mike Johnson, you know that, right? Yeah, yeah. She didn't get along with him last year, but she thinks that Trump is not weak. He's the only one that's not weak, according to her. She's also saying that one of the- So she's attacking her own party right now. So you say, you have the question, what's gonna happen? I think that somebody like her could take the whole thing down.",1.0
348.925,359.404,SPEAKER_05,"Well, also Mike Lawler in New York has come out in favor of extending the Obamacare subsidies for one year, which is different than the Democrats demand. But there is a bit of a bipartisan push to-",1.0
359.384,448.318,SPEAKER_10,"Americans want it. Everyone wants the subsidies to continue. They want the Affordable Care Act to continue. And the reason I think that Mike Johnson is not holding session is because Donald Trump wants to screw up. Obama's legacy. This is all about Donald Trump being the small, petty man that he is, and he doesn't want Obama to have that legacy. But what I will say is I think what will change things is when Americans will really start feeling this shutdown, because at this point, you know, as you mentioned, there are all these workarounds being done, but the most at-risk Americans are going to suffer from these layoffs. Schoolchildren, low-income families, homeless, unhoused people, and senior citizens. At the CDC, I hope everybody knows, more than half of the dismissals were reversed. Staffers working on measles response and handling an Ebola outbreak were fired. The entire staff of the morbidity and mortality weekly report were terminated and then reinstated because that was a huge mistake. But the entire staff of special education and rehabilitative services, including the Office on Special Education, was let go. That means kids with learning disabilities. That means kids that really need special education. They won't have those resources anymore. And when those parents realize that their kids are suffering, I think that's when Americans will really stand up. You know what I think is going to happen?",1.0

466.323,486.298,SPEAKER_11,"Yes, yes. Air travel. Well, to your point about when people will feel it, it's actually going to be if these subsidies are not extended because it's going to raise health care costs by 114% by those who are enrolled. And they say that the majority of people it will affect don't even realize they're going to be affected. Yes, and it's about 20 million Americans, I think. 22 million.",1.0
486.318,510.286,SPEAKER_05,"22 million Americans. And what I appreciated, Mike Lawler from New York had said, who's a Republican, that there's a lot of Republicans who still think healthcare premiums are too high under Obamacare, but so long as that is the system in place and nobody is offering some sweeping alternative to make healthcare affordable, then you have to continue to extend these subsidies, even if it's short-term for one year. But this whole idea that after a million times of trying to repeal it, nothing to replace it, you can just end the subsidy.",1.0

And she's now shared that. It makes me so angry how that tabloid culture just feels that they have this right to things about your life and your body and your health, and they'll just run with it.

You know, if IVF doesn't work, if IUI doesn't work, you can always think about a surrogate, which is very expensive. All those options are expensive. And the least expensive option is generally adoption. And so it's on the table for people. And so she obviously went through this journey, this infertility journey. journey which we both know is very very difficult but she wanted to have a biological child yeah but to your point joy you know my sister-in-law never wanted biological children she's an ob-gyn um and has delivered so many babies but for her that was her path and she adopted our nephew my nephew he's the most incredible kid they have up",1.0

1465.93,1504.337,SPEAKER_06,"I was guarded about it. It was complicated, right? Because it's a big change politically. He starts out as a Democrat. When I first registered to vote, I registered as an independent. Through the years, I changed to a Democrat. And now I'm back to independent.

So that's the problem that we're having.",1.0
1533.538,1567.363,SPEAKER_06,"OK. I understand. I understand that. And it's interesting because, I don't know if you saw, 60 Minutes just did a piece about the vaccine injury a compensation program. So people that have had vaccine injuries can be compensated if they can prove it. And they have paid out $5.4 billion for vaccine injuries. So my question is, can we do better?
