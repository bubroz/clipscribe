1.184,3.146,SPEAKER_02, I know you're used to CEOs who don't answer your question.,1.0
3.166,4.748,SPEAKER_02,I'm going to directly answer your question.,1.0
6.63,18.364,SPEAKER_02,"I get yelled at all the time for Ukraine, ICE, Israel, and generally telling the truth, which I would call, okay, the chance of world survival goes up as America becomes stronger and more dominant.",1.0
22.768,26.374,SPEAKER_03," Alex Karp, thanks for having us into the Palantir lair in Manhattan.",1.0
26.674,27.936,SPEAKER_03,Welcome to The Axios Show.,1.0
28.437,31.021,SPEAKER_03,"You're CEO, co-founder of Palantir.",1.0
31.381,32.323,SPEAKER_03,What the hell is Palantir?,1.0
33.769,35.371,SPEAKER_02," Well, it depends who I'm talking to.",1.0
36.852,39.695,SPEAKER_02,"Well, if I'm talking to you, we are growing the GDP of the US.",1.0
40.275,49.004,SPEAKER_02,"We are the part of the GDP of the AI economy where things are useful, either on the battlefield or commercially.",1.0
49.965,54.97,SPEAKER_02,And we're the only AI company with a real spread function to the working class Americans.,1.0
55.41,67.953,SPEAKER_02," If it's the third or fourth conversation, it would be more like we went long on the reality that large language models were useful in their application, in our software, and are not going to be as performing as people want outside of it.",1.0
72.074,77.915,SPEAKER_03,"You talk about a single pane of glass, right, that connects AI, connects data, connects analytics.",1.0
78.155,80.475,SPEAKER_03,Let's give viewers an example.,1.0
80.915,83.536,SPEAKER_03,I'm a commander in the battlefield. What can...,1.0
84.861,87.003,SPEAKER_03," Palantir, tell me about my assets.",1.0
87.603,93.368,SPEAKER_02,"Well, if you're a commander in the battlefield for the first time, you have access to all your assets.",1.0
93.508,99.072,SPEAKER_02,"When I say all, I mean also assets of foreign countries you work with that are sharing a subset of the data.",1.0
100.754,103.356,SPEAKER_03,So I'm looking at this pane of glass and what does it show me?,1.0
104.335,116.199,SPEAKER_02," Well, it probably at this point is showing, again, it depends what you're doing, but it's probably showing if you're, say, doing a complex operation, it's showing you where the plane should fly, where the troops should be, where the missiles should go, where they shouldn't go.",1.0
116.52,121.102,SPEAKER_02,"And again, it's doing this off of data sets that were not available to you  last year.",1.0
121.442,124.425,SPEAKER_02,It's also be able to predict where you should put your assets.,1.0
124.985,131.191,SPEAKER_02,It can and will soon be able to pick up what kind of missiles do you put on what kind of targets.,1.0
131.211,134.614,SPEAKER_02,So do you put your really expensive missiles on your really expensive targets?,1.0
135.074,141.139,SPEAKER_02,"It will at some point, and again, this is one of the most important things that's overlooked, be able to totally orchestrate the supply chain.",1.0
141.179,142.12,SPEAKER_02,So what are you building?,1.0
142.16,142.901,SPEAKER_02,How are you building it?,1.0
142.941,143.762,SPEAKER_02,Where is it be building?,1.0
144.422,149.865,SPEAKER_02," what companies are doing it, understanding the cost for those companies, which is currently something that's very, very hard for those companies.",1.0
149.906,159.311,SPEAKER_02,"So there's the kind of sexy, violent part of war, which obviously in this case would mean, honestly, for this commander, what it basically will mean is you will be ahead of your adversary.",1.0
159.331,160.632,SPEAKER_02,You'll be able to predict their actions.,1.0
160.952,172.379,SPEAKER_02,"You'll be able to put the best effectors on the most important targets and the cheaper ones on less important targets, i.e., by the way, honestly, the most important thing Palantir does is prevent war.",1.0
172.76,174.488,SPEAKER_03, So that sounds very useful.,1.0
174.729,176.457,SPEAKER_03,Why are people so suspicious of you?,1.0
178.072,181.973,SPEAKER_02," Well, I actually would push back on that, which people are suspicious.",1.0
182.433,184.213,SPEAKER_02,"So like, you know, it's really interesting.",1.0
184.233,187.394,SPEAKER_02,"I was watching someone on TV who was like, I talk to special operators.",1.0
187.454,188.574,SPEAKER_02,I talk to military people.,1.0
188.674,189.734,SPEAKER_02,They love to volunteer.,1.0
190.335,206.018,SPEAKER_02,"Okay, so I'm just going to say for the sake of being somewhat of a jerk, the people I care about, the people on the front line in factories, the people driving trucks, the people doing things, the people who've used our products, the war fighters, how did we get our business off the ground?",1.0
206.658,212.602,SPEAKER_02," were fighters who are sacrificing their lives, went to generals and said, I don't care what stars you have, I'm coming home alive.",1.0
212.982,217.364,SPEAKER_02,"You know, a lot of those people are suspicious of us now, try to take the product out of their hands.",1.0
217.965,222.628,SPEAKER_02,"Almost all of our clients, meaning people who've bought our product, started off as Palantir skeptics.",1.0
223.428,226.371,SPEAKER_02, And I've gone into tens of thousands of meetings.,1.0
226.772,228.754,SPEAKER_02,"Now, currently, when I meet the pound, you're skeptic.",1.0
228.854,240.005,SPEAKER_02,"I'm like, that's the person who's going to buy because they have legitimate questions like, is this product being used to take away my right to go have a hot dog with a coworker I'm flirting with while being married?",1.0
240.265,243.726,SPEAKER_02," which honestly, you know, I think is the God-given right of people in this country.",1.0
244.146,248.247,SPEAKER_02,Can I take the day off and tell my employer I'm working when I'm not? Great.,1.0
248.467,250.148,SPEAKER_02,"Maybe you shouldn't do that, but I support that.",1.0
250.548,253.529,SPEAKER_02,Can I have views that are deviant from my bosses?,1.0
253.569,264.152,SPEAKER_02,"Like, I mean, actually, we have an environment here where you can have any view you want, but let's just say somebody here hates what we're doing at ICE, hates what we're doing in Israel, and hates what we're doing in Ukraine, and doesn't somehow want to express it.",1.0
264.252,267.052,SPEAKER_02,"It would be incorrect to think they'll be penalized for it, but they think that.",1.0
267.332,269.073,SPEAKER_02,Can I have that view at home in my house?,1.0
270.083,279.92,SPEAKER_02," What I would tell those people is listen carefully to the people who are saying we're doing surveillance, listen to every word they say, write those words down, spend 10 minutes looking at our product.",1.0
280.641,282.344,SPEAKER_02,"And you know, you decide.",1.0
283.047,285.409,SPEAKER_03, Zoom out beyond Palantir and society.,1.0
285.489,288.572,SPEAKER_03,How worried are you about a surveillance state?,1.0
288.692,294.157,SPEAKER_02,"Our primary worry should be, are our enemies so scared of us that they do not fight with us?",1.0
294.277,295.418,SPEAKER_03,And who's our enemies?,1.0
295.458,298.281,SPEAKER_02,"Well, you know, I mean, you pick your like, you know, the usual.",1.0
298.321,299.382,SPEAKER_02,We do not sell to China.,1.0
299.402,300.483,SPEAKER_02,We don't sell to Iran.,1.0
300.503,301.384,SPEAKER_02,We don't sell to Russia.,1.0
301.724,307.028,SPEAKER_02," I actually would say adversaries, not enemies, because I think when you get an enemy thing, it's a way of being dysfunctional.",1.0
307.048,310.19,SPEAKER_02,But are people scared of us?,1.0
310.55,313.152,SPEAKER_02,Do terrorists plan terrorist attacks against us?,1.0
313.512,315.914,SPEAKER_02,Or do they feel that they shouldn't because they're so scared?,1.0
316.554,319.636,SPEAKER_02,"And by the way, that's the single best way to ever stop wars.",1.0
319.916,326.02,SPEAKER_02,The primary evidence for a surveillance state in the West is not government on consumer.,1.0
326.521,331.064,SPEAKER_02,It's company knowing every single action you have at all times.,1.0
331.784,336.229,SPEAKER_02, And we walk around with surveillance devices called electronic devices.,1.0
336.529,339.612,SPEAKER_02,And every single thing we do is monitored.,1.0
340.073,349.502,SPEAKER_02,"Not, I think, primarily so people can eviscerate or have an understanding of, am I shagging with too many people on the side and lying to my partner or lying by omission?",1.0
349.922,351.924,SPEAKER_02,Because they want to sell us like cornflakes.,1.0
352.685,354.747,SPEAKER_02, That's the reality of life in the West.,1.0
355.047,358.189,SPEAKER_02,Can the government surveil your patterns of behavior?,1.0
358.59,362.953,SPEAKER_02,"It's called pattern of life surveillance, which is a very, very, very important way of finding terrorists.",1.0
363.353,366.536,SPEAKER_02,"And in general, criminals, because everyone has a pattern.",1.0
366.556,367.376,SPEAKER_02,So you're saying it's worth it?,1.0
367.817,368.517,SPEAKER_02,"No, I'm not saying that.",1.0
368.697,373.521,SPEAKER_02,"Here, the problem is these things require very, very precise tools.",1.0
373.701,376.723,SPEAKER_02,"Yes, we are monetizing the fact that these decisions are difficult.",1.0
376.984,378.865,SPEAKER_02,We're monetizing the fact that they're hard.,1.0
379.125,381.047,SPEAKER_02,We're monetizing the fact that they're important.,1.0
390.879,392.78,SPEAKER_02, And it's not always raining.,1.0
393.42,395.601,SPEAKER_02,There'll be days like this.,1.0
396.602,399.263,SPEAKER_02,When there's no one complaining.,1.0
399.303,401.464,SPEAKER_02,There'll be days like this.,1.0
404.125,408.987,SPEAKER_02,My mama told me.,1.0
409.007,411.028,SPEAKER_02,This way is way faster.,1.0
411.048,413.389,SPEAKER_02,There'll be days like this.,1.0
418.806,424.753,SPEAKER_03," So you talked about how AI can increase prosperity, both of the individual and of the country.",1.0
425.274,426.876,SPEAKER_03,Go dark with me for a second.,1.0
426.936,429.079,SPEAKER_03,You are a truth teller.,1.0
429.639,431.402,SPEAKER_03,What should we worry about AI?,1.0
431.462,432.403,SPEAKER_03,How can it go wrong?,1.0
433.581,434.943,SPEAKER_02," Well, it could go wrong in lots of ways.",1.0
434.983,444.615,SPEAKER_02,"But again, there I would say we need to absorb a lot of risk there because it's either going to go right and wrong for us or it's going to go right and wrong for China, which we're in a competition.",1.0
444.655,446.237,SPEAKER_02,"At the very least, we're in high competition.",1.0
446.297,447.358,SPEAKER_02,What about for the individual?,1.0
447.678,448.9,SPEAKER_02,No decision is without risk.,1.0
449.921,456.966,SPEAKER_02, And the risk we have to absorb here is going long on this because it's not like we're not doing this in a vacuum.,1.0
457.386,461.229,SPEAKER_02,We are going to be the dominant player or China is going to be the dominant player.,1.0
461.369,464.231,SPEAKER_02,And there will just be very different rules depending on who wins.,1.0
464.351,470.855,SPEAKER_02,"And we cannot rely on anyone else to do this in our network of allies because Europe has given up on technology. And actually,",1.0
471.235,474.863,SPEAKER_02, The Arab and non-Arab Middle East are closest to what you see at AI adoption.,1.0
474.903,477.668,SPEAKER_02,"But de facto, we are by far the leader of our coalition.",1.0
478.069,480.394,SPEAKER_02,"So it's like when people are worried about surveillance, it's not...",1.0
481.311,490.076,SPEAKER_02," Honestly, of course, there are huge dangers there, but it's like you will have far fewer rights if America's not in the lead.",1.0
490.817,494.599,SPEAKER_02,"And I'll tell you the other risk that, again, I think it doesn't get enough attention.",1.0
495.059,499.722,SPEAKER_02,"Again, what portion of the wealth creation is available to the average person?",1.0
500.142,501.643,SPEAKER_02,I'm pretty sure we're in our infancy.,1.0
501.983,503.945,SPEAKER_02,"So in a world where Palantir could grow 10X,",1.0
506.573,510.577,SPEAKER_02, What does that mean to the person on the factory floor?,1.0
510.697,512.318,SPEAKER_02,How much are their real wages going to grow?,1.0
512.959,519.965,SPEAKER_02,"Like, and if the answer is, you know, 5% roughly at inflation, can you blame them for not being upset?",1.0
520.786,524.81,SPEAKER_02,"And so, like, I think the primary risk of AI is social instability.",1.0
525.23,527.312,SPEAKER_02,Like the person- And what form will that take?,1.0
528.828,532.61,SPEAKER_02, pretty crazy populist movements that obviously make no sense.,1.0
532.891,538.074,SPEAKER_02,"Like, I mean, I don't know, like, you know, we're going to all, we're going to make, the government is going to run grocery stores.",1.0
538.194,540.435,SPEAKER_02,"Are you worried about violence, indolence?",1.0
541.916,543.437,SPEAKER_02,"Well, dysfunction and then violence.",1.0
543.757,548.8,SPEAKER_02,"Like, you talk to European leaders and they will literally look you in private and tell you,",1.0
549.56,553.082,SPEAKER_02, Negative GDP isn't a problem because the quality of our revenue is going up.,1.0
553.183,553.743,SPEAKER_02,They believe this.,1.0
553.903,554.984,SPEAKER_02,This is clearly wrong.,1.0
555.044,555.744,SPEAKER_02,It will not work.,1.0
555.804,558.186,SPEAKER_02,"It's going to lead to violence, indolence.",1.0
559.427,560.968,SPEAKER_02,It's going to lead to everything you don't want.,1.0
561.328,572.195,SPEAKER_02,"And OK, so then the American version is you as builder, highly educated builder who's asking technical proximate questions are likely to do well.",1.0
573.823,574.964,SPEAKER_02, What about everyone here?,1.0
575.624,576.905,SPEAKER_02,How well does your camera person do?,1.0
577.385,578.225,SPEAKER_03,"Yeah, so that's a good question.",1.0
578.245,586.87,SPEAKER_03,"So we've talked about who will benefit from this prosperity, but who, what occupations, what types of businesses should be freaking the hell out?",1.0
588.044,594.086,SPEAKER_02," Okay, let me give you the way you should, again, because I think the actual, you should not be freaking out is pretty crazy to most people.",1.0
594.526,599.668,SPEAKER_02,The thing about the commodity nature of LLMs is it commodifies general knowledge.,1.0
599.848,604.41,SPEAKER_02,"My advice to people around here is, you know, there's a couple of schools you should go to if you get into.",1.0
604.49,605.79,SPEAKER_02,"Yale's one, Stanford's one.",1.0
606.03,607.631,SPEAKER_02,There's some schools you maybe should go to.,1.0
607.971,611.112,SPEAKER_02,"Otherwise, go to the cheapest school and come to Palantir or just come here.",1.0
611.172,611.992,SPEAKER_02,That's my honest advice.,1.0
612.352,614.633,SPEAKER_02,"So to people like family members, others, Evers.",1.0
614.833,618.217,SPEAKER_02," So I pick on Yale because it's a crazy strong, especially for humanities.",1.0
618.257,620.7,SPEAKER_02,Almost everyone I work with that writes is a Yale grad.,1.0
621.161,623.023,SPEAKER_02,"So it's a very, very strong school.",1.0
623.043,634.937,SPEAKER_02,"But like if you are the kind of person that would have gone to Yale, would have kind of classically high IQ and you have generalized knowledge, but it's not specific.",1.0
636.403,637.183,SPEAKER_02, you're effed.,1.0
638.243,647.065,SPEAKER_02,"If, on the other hand, you have specific domain knowledge, like how do I actually bend the metal of the hull on a ship?",1.0
647.865,652.766,SPEAKER_02,How do I actually write a script that allows me to target terrorists in Palantir?,1.0
653.166,662.688,SPEAKER_02,How do I impute the problem in this complicated device that's going wrong that otherwise would be fixed by a Japanese engineer while being a high school grad?,1.0
663.408,670.338,SPEAKER_02, How do I put the cement in a factory with such precision that you can build a factory like it was built in Taiwan in America?,1.0
671.139,678.77,SPEAKER_02,"How do I do anything with deep, specific, particularly what's considered vocational training",1.0
679.668,687.914,SPEAKER_02, Those people are going to make a lot more money simply because you can turn it any way you want.,1.0
688.134,695.118,SPEAKER_02,"But at the end of the day, within a relative rapid amount of time, you will get paid downstream of the value you create.",1.0
695.138,699.021,SPEAKER_03,So an electrician is going to be a lot better off than a lame Yale grad.,1.0
699.215,702.817,SPEAKER_02, The Yale grad will have to learn something specific.,1.0
702.997,703.978,SPEAKER_02,Domain expertise.,1.0
704.038,705.258,SPEAKER_02,Domain expertise.,1.0
705.558,709.28,SPEAKER_03,What dark forces are you worried about getting their hands on?,1.0
710.161,711.762,SPEAKER_02,There are a lot of dark forces.,1.0
712.122,714.463,SPEAKER_02,I just want to keep repeating this.,1.0
714.483,719.866,SPEAKER_02,"Are you more concerned about- No, I'm much more concerned that we fail in America and that we don't dominate.",1.0
720.006,728.611,SPEAKER_02,"And therefore, there's a lame UN-driven discussion about human rights that obviously only serves people who somehow want to live in a world that doesn't work.",1.0
728.971,735.436,SPEAKER_03," Something that's always baffled me, you know, everyone in Silicon Valley, a lot of moguls are building bunkers.",1.0
736.136,737.517,SPEAKER_03,What do they know that we don't?,1.0
737.597,739.719,SPEAKER_03,What do they fear that we maybe should?,1.0
740.079,741.64,SPEAKER_02,I think they have the same fears you do.,1.0
741.7,742.541,SPEAKER_02,They just have more money.,1.0
743.561,755.33,SPEAKER_02,People who do well in Silicon Valley are more mathematically adept than they may realize or than other people and have an ability to operate.,1.0
756.21,765.313,SPEAKER_02," And so, again, if you just take odds, you know, it's like, you know, a lot like if it's no different, I bet you a lot of hedge funders have these just like you're doing a regression.",1.0
765.753,778.098,SPEAKER_02,"But like, you know, it's like I remember I've talked I end up talking to political people and I was like, you know, it's like when you talk to campaigns are like we have a 25 percent chance of losing and they're like and they're off drinking champagne.",1.0
778.578,784.38,SPEAKER_02,And anyone in tech is like you have a 25 percent chance of non-recoverable death.,1.0
785.103,787.706,SPEAKER_02," So it's just, it's a different, I mean, a lot of this is just mathematical.",1.0
787.806,798.597,SPEAKER_03,"So while we're on that, in Silicon Valley, they talk about the P-Doom, the probability that super intelligent AI is going to end Saul. You know what?",1.0
798.677,801.981,SPEAKER_02,"I'm happy to talk about anything that like, I think.",1.0
802.361,803.082,SPEAKER_02,Do you have a P-Doom?,1.0
803.362,806.546,SPEAKER_02,I worry much more about we lose the race.,1.0
807.628,811.99,SPEAKER_02," Like again, I'm very culturally specific in a way that maybe, you know, not everyone is.",1.0
812.21,819.954,SPEAKER_02,"I think the chance of you, of American survival goes, the chance of world survival goes up as America becomes stronger and more dominant.",1.0
