    "full_text": "The service disabled veteran owned small business certification program. What is it? Why would you want it? Who qualifies for it? How can you use it? That's what we're talking about today. During our live stream. So, for those of you that don't know me, my name is Rick Howard, I'm a former government acquisitions officer. I managed over 82 billion dollars in government contracts. Then went on to start Gov Close. which trains the sales executives in small businesses onto the government today. So, now we're talking about certifications. And if you've been tuning in, uh lately, each day we've been covering a different topic as it pertains to government contracting. This one is definitely more focused on veterans. And the service disabled veteran owned small business certification specifically today. What I'm going to talk about is what it is, who qualifies for it, how do you apply for it? So, I'm going to walk through the SBA website, uh Small Business Administration website. Um I've gotten it. I have it. It's not that hard to get, but do you even need it? And once we, hey Brett, uh once we define what it is and how you would apply for it and whatnot, then we got to figure out, okay, how can I use the service disabled veteran owned small business certification. So if you're a veteran, assuming you either want to start a business or you have a business, is this something that's even worth your time? If so, how do we utilize it? And I'll show you how to do that and give you some best practices that I've seen through my acquisitions career in the Air Force, uh looking and putting companies on contract and, um, knowing how that SDVOSB certification is utilized. And actually, even more practically, how I've used it with my consulting business helping companies that have that certification with their contracting. So this is going to be a hands-on, very tactical episode walking you through the different things that you can do to utilize that certification and side if it's right for you. Because what you don't want to do is waste anybody's time. Government contracting is not for everybody. Okay? So, why don't we get into it here? First thing I'm going to do is I'm going to take you to the SBA website, and we're just going to go through how do you decide if you qualify for the service disabled veteran owned small business certification? And how do you get it? But let's, before we even get into that, let's talk about what these certifications or set-asides are, and why they exist. Okay? So, the U.S. federal government is the single biggest purchaser of goods and services in the world. And they are required to buy from small businesses. The Small Business Administration is the federal agency that sets the goals for the federal agencies for how much they're going to award to small businesses. Now, about 23% of federal spending each year goes to small businesses, although they often exceed that. Right? As they did last year. So, to the tune, it's around 180 billion dollars that went to small businesses last year. That's a lot, and they buy everything. So, I'm not just talking weapons, missiles, and stuff like that. We're talking everything that you could think of from landscaping and construction to satellite technology, right? So, in everything in between, social media management, you name it. They're probably buying it. So, now, okay, we have small business goals, right? But what about, what are these certifications? What are these set-asides, Rick, that you're talking about? Let's talk about what they are. Let's talk about what the main ones are, okay? Because, uh, there's a lot of ways to self-declare what your business is, but most of the certifications that could move the needle for your business involve an application process and a vetting process. So, uh, 8a, right, which is a disadvantaged certification you can get, takes a while to get it. Um, that has a lot of benefits. We'll cover 8a in a different episode. Another certification that potentially could move the needle for you is HubZone, right? And that really depends on where your business is located. There's a HubZone map you can, uh, check that on. There's woman-owned small business, right? Again, you have to apply for this through the SBA. And then there's service disabled veteran-owned small business. And I'm not mentioning veteran-owned small business. I'm speci- specifying service disabled veteran-owned small business, and I'm specifying that for a reason. It's because the SDVOSB certification has a, uh, a goal, a contracting goal associated with it. So, uh, there's a percentage of contracts that the SBA is saying should go to the service disabled veteran-owned small businesses across the agencies, right? So, that matters. So, okay, we have a small business goal that the government has of around 23%, it varies a little bit, right? And then we have a subset which actually specifies what the percentage of contracts should go to the certifications that I named, including service disabled veteran-owned small business. Now, one of the agencies, one of the federal agencies has to look at service disabled veteran-owned small business companies first. In fact, it's called Veterans First, something something along those lines. So, we're going to talk about that. Now, that's, that can be a very powerful avenue. I always tell people, don't hang your hat on these certifications. You know, first, you need a business, and you need to be able to provide a good or service, a product or service, uh, and you have to be great at it, right? And I often tell people, make sure you're selling, you know, B2B, B2C first, and then look at selling to the government. These certifications can help you win government contracts, because government contracting, guys, is not a, it's not the easy button, right? It's the hard button, right? This is a, a long process, but it can be very lucrative, okay? And if you are a veteran and you're thinking, hey, maybe I can grab a SDVOSB certification, it can certainly help you in the process. And so, by the end of this, my goal is for you to be able to make a logical decision as to, hey, does this apply to me? And I want to go through the application process, which actually is pretty easy for this certification, unlike the other ones. Or it's a waste of my time, and I'll move on. And either way, I think, uh, you'll have value there. And then, of course, if you do get it, I'm going to give you a lot of tips on how you can use it. So, I'm going to share my screen here. If I can find the right screen to share. There we go. All right, so what are we looking at right now? Right now, we are looking at the SBA website, specifically for SDVOSB. And, there we go. That makes it a little bit clearer. If you have any questions during this, feel free to, uh, throw them in the comments. I'll answer them as I can. So, the first place, this is the first place I would recommend you go. So, what, what is going to, um, what do you need big picture? I'm going to show you exactly, but what do you, big picture, what are you going to need to get this certification? First of all, if you want the service disabled veteran owned small business certification, you have to be a service disabled veteran. And unlike the, the policy that decides whether or not you're going to get paid as a disabled veteran, so, a lot of you guys know, when you leave the military, if your, and for those of you that don't know, when you leave the military, uh, the VA will do disability, uh, check on you. That's not the official, uh, term for it, but if you're over 50% disabled, like all of the things that you've gotten in the military add up, over 50%, you start getting paid for your disability. But that's not, that's not the case for the SDVOSB certification. Unless something's changed, and I don't think it's changed since I last read this, you just have to be, uh, some percentage disabled. So, you can be below 50% uh, of uh, disabled, but you're going to need that disability letter. So, they're not going to take your word for it. You're going to need to provide the documentation. We'll talk about that, but so just if you're service disabled in any capacity, this could apply to you. Now, you're also going to need a business, right? So, you're going to need a registered business. The other thing you're going to want to, going to want to have is a registration in SAM.gov. Okay? And by the way, we can cover that if, if you need it. I don't know if anybody watching this is going to need it. Now, so, provided you are a service disabled veteran of any percentage, and even if you're just thinking of starting a business, this is, this, you may, uh, benefit from going to this website. Okay. So, this is going to talk about the federal programs, right? So, it's talking about contracting opportunities for vets, veteran small business certification program. Vet Cert. SDVOSB. SDVOSB is the one that's going to move the needle here, guys. Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business. And again, it's not a windfall. Getting the certification does not mean that government contracts are going to fall into your lap. There's a lot of work that goes into it. It can help, but it's not an easy button. Um, and there's some other programs here, too. Now, again, with government contracting, so, it's always more complicated than they make it out to seem. So, they're talking about, hey, if you have this certification, you can, you're now eligible to, um, compete for contracts that are set aside for veterans. True. Again, there's a lot more that goes into it. So, to apply for SDVOSB, it's going to be through this website. It used to be, now if you're, uh, an older gentleman or a woman, uh, like myself, you may have done this before through the VA. But it has since moved to the SBA. Okay? So, now, if you want the service disabled veteran-owned small business certification, you are going to go through SBA.gov. And you are going to, uh, click this, uh, Apply Now. But before I show you guys this, we're going to go down. Now, if you want to actually read the guidance and, um, you know, what the law says about the SDVOSB certification, it's going to give you links here. Okay? And then, it's then going to go into, how do I apply for the certification? This is very self-explanatory, and I want to be specific for the veterans out there. If you don't have this certification, you do not need to pay somebody to get this. In fact, I advise you not to pay somebody to do this for you. This is not a complicated process. You can do this yourself. If you have questions, I've been through the process myself. My business is SDVOSB, so I can give you some pointers. You don't need to pay anyone for this. This is something that you can do on your own. And it takes a couple of weeks. It could take a month, but that's a lot shorter than a lot of the certifications out there. All right. Uh, it does go through some frequently asked questions. It goes through the, um, SBA veteran fact sheet, which I advise you to take a look at. We might take a look at here today. And then some eligibility requirements. All right? So, now, the big one they talk about here, so there's some they talk about and there's some they don't talk about. Um, you have to be identified, so there's also, you can be a VOSB, veteran-owned small business, but there's no percentage associated with this one. Meaning, there's no requirement for, unless I missed something, that the government has to set aside VOSB. It's the service disabled veteran-owned small business certification that they are setting, and they say, hey, this amount of contracts, this percentage, should go to small businesses that are registered SDVOSB. Some of the information on here is straightforward, some of it is misleading. Uh, but it says you have to be a veteran or a service disabled veteran. It says you have to be a small business as defined by size standard. All that means, guys, there's something called a NAICS code. There's hundreds if not thousands of them. And those codes, depending on what you're selling, will determine if you're a small business. It's usually by number of employees or amount of revenue you're generating each year. For employees, it's typically 500 or less, you're a small business, or if it's revenue, it can, it can actually vary pretty dramatically. Uh, you know, like, if you're in the trades, it might be 8 million a year or less, you're a small business. If it's something like software, computer or anything, it might be in the 20 million dollar range. But, again, just to know that. And you can look it up. You can look up what the size standards are with the NAICS codes. We're not going to do that today, but if you're trying to figure out if you're a small business, you can do that there. Now, it says here, this is important, right? The business owner, it has to be no less than 51% owned or controlled by a veteran. And in the SDVOSB certification case, that means the owner has to be, if you have a split up between two people, three people, whatever, 51% has to be owned by the veterans. And you can see here, for certification is SDVOSB, no less than 51% of the business is owned and controlled by one or more veterans, rated as service disabled by the VA. All right? Okay, so, great. What are we looking at here? So, when you click on, I just wanted to show you how you're actually going to apply for this if it's something you're interested in. Now, you're going to have to, uh, set up an account, but there are some, uh, preparations and for here, you can click on, it's preparation for application. There's a quiz that you can take. It'll walk you through like, hey, do you have a business? Are you a veteran? Certain questions like that to decide if you're ready for the application process yet, right? Because you're going to want a business first. You want to make sure you have a business, okay? You can't register for a veteran-owned business if you don't already have a business. If you're wondering what you need to do to start a business, that is something that you're going to, it's more like, uh, you're going to go, I did mine, I think, when I retired, maybe even before I retired from the military. I just went through LegalZoom and started out, uh, just registered, filed for an LLC over there. There are some, there are a bunch of, you could do it yourself, you don't need that. You could use a lawyer, you could go through, there's a couple of other, um, websites like LegalZoom that I've used and and wasn't happy with. So, um, I will say this, it's a lot easier to start your business than it is to dissolve your business. So, just keep that in mind. And you're going to have, uh, you're going to have taxes that you have to pay on them. Even if you don't make any money, there are going to be certain forms you have to file every year just to stay legal. Um, there's going to be certain fees that you have to pay. So, just keep that in mind when you register that business. But the first step, have that business. And then you can go here, which is the SBA website, which talks about how you can prepare for the application and whatnot. Now, I did want to, um, show this because this doesn't, this is not covered in the SBA, uh, website. At least not, it's not obvious because I mentioned earlier, one of the questions that we have is, oh, do I have to be, this is what I had, I'm like, do I have to be over 50% disabled from the VA in order to, uh, qualify for SDVOSB certification, which by the way, again, the SDVOSB certification, that's the one you want. That's the one that can move the needle the most. Now, I just wanted to show you here the actual, uh, regulation. Service disabled, for this, for this certification, means a veteran who possesses either a valid disability rating letter issued by the Department of Veteran Affairs establishing a service-connected rating between 0 and 100% or a valid disability determination from the DoD or is registered in, you know, some but this is the part that is going to, um, apply to most of you. So, between 0 and 100%. So, you can qualify for this. You don't have to be over 50%. Okay? And this goes on. This is, there is a lot, um, in this right here. Now, some of the SDVOSB specifics. Again, I want, I want to give you resources that you can go to and read this a little bit more in depth. Again, I'm on SBA.gov. I can drop, um, the link here. And in the comments. Hopefully that goes out to all the platforms we're streaming on here. So, this is the page that I'm on right now. And it's talking about how, okay, what are the disabled veterans, uh, program contracts. And now right here, it's talking about, you compete for contracts that are set aside. So, if a contract is set aside from the government, that means typically on SAM.gov, you're going to see a request for proposal or request for quote. Let's say for landscaping services, and it will say set aside for service disabled veteran owned small business. That means you cannot submit a proposal on that R F for the RFP, it, or that solicitation, unless you have this certification. So, basically, it eliminates all the competition that doesn't have that certification. But this is not, this is not where the certification becomes valuable. Right? So, I'm leading up, at the end, that's when we're going to go over the most valuable way to use this set aside and this certification. And it's not just by going and taking a look at, hey, are these RFPs coming out or are they already set aside. I'm going to tell you and show you how we use it with our clients and how we teach our students in Gov Close. Um, by the way, if you want to really become an expert at this and want your, your business to go to GovClose.com. But, uh, so, it starts talking, this is why I say, some of this information that we find on websites like the SBA, it gives you, it gives you a little bit, but it doesn't give you the whole picture. Okay? All right, great. There are sole source contracts for disabled veterans. Awesome. But you got to have a business, a product or service you're selling, right? In order to win those. Um, okay, and then it's talking about, you know, hey, how to find disabled veteran program contracts. That doesn't really matter. I mean, you are going to end up in a registry. Uh, let me see here. I think I did, I looked up mine really quickly. Once you are, here we go, here's me. Rick Sea Howard LLC. And you can see it lists that I am, uh, I have an active SDVOSB certification, right? So, this will happen for you as well. And it gives my email address, also gives my address. So, just be aware, like, when you register your business to sell to the government, and you get these certifications, your information is going to be now publicly available. Okay? It's not proprietary to you. Anyone can go find it. And that's for a reason. The U.S. government, um, part of the reason the Federal Acquisitions Regulations exist is so the taxpayer, who's paying for all of this stuff, can see, hey, who is winning these contracts? What are the contracts for? What's going on here? So, uh, I just wanted to show you one of the places here. This is the Dynamic Small Business Search through SBA. This is one of the many places that your information will become available. Where else is it going to be? Uh, well, it's going to be all over the place. But, it's going to be in SAM.gov, because you're going to register in SAM.gov. It's going to be in, um, FPDS potentially if you win contracts. It could potentially be in USA Spending.gov. And then there are a bunch of websites and applications, especially today, with all the AI stuff going on out there, search tools, market research tools. So, there's a lot of place, places where you can, uh, where your information can end up. So, I just wanted to, uh, talk about that. Now, okay, Rick, we, uh, kind of showed me, hey, how do I apply? How do I qualify for this? I didn't go into extensive detail on the qualification. We can if you want to. I could go through, I mean, there is a good checklist. I think I have, I think it's on this page right here where it says, how to apply. Oh, here's your, here's the fact sheet, right? This is actually a good one. I'm going to put this link in here. Because I think anyone that is looking at this certification, um, should read through this. All right, so you guys, uh, depending on where you're actually watching this, if you're watching it on LinkedIn, I just, uh, dumped that link into the comments under the title, fact sheet. If you're re-watching this on YouTube after it went live, you should be able to pull up a live comments section, uh, through YouTube and get to that. If you're watching it live now, um, you can just go into the comments and click on the link. And so, what should pop up is this SBA preparing for SBA Small Business certification. Now, it's giving you some of the eligibility, small business, 51% owned. We already covered this. It's giving, but here's some interesting stuff that, uh, we didn't cover already. Um, if you certified before, it's talking about through, because the certification used to be through the VA. Now it's through the SBA. Talking about a grace period, um, how to use DSBS. But here's a VetCert, uh, webinar. So, if you do want more training on it, you can take a look here. It looks like the second and fourth Thursdays of each month at 2:00 p.m., you can go, uh, through the SBA, you can, uh, just go into this webinar. So, that's cool. And, it gives you some other gobbledygook, uh, to look through here. Here, what is it? Some other administration. So, before you begin, like we talked about, be registered in SAM.gov. I have a whole video on that. You guys can, uh, look it up on, uh, YouTube. It's the Gov Close is our YouTube channel, just GOVCLOSE. And you can just see my walk through on how to register for SAM.gov. But you have some frequently asked questions, and this is, this is key. I think, really of everything on here, guys, what's going to save you time is this checklist here. It's talking about gather the required documentation. You want to have this documentation all handy. So, it's probably going to want your business, uh, registration forms with the IRS. It's going to probably want your, um, your forms, or it's not going to say probably, it's going to want your forms, uh, with your disability, if you're going for the SDVOSB certification. So, there's a few things there that you want to gather before you actually go and apply. But again, don't pay somebody to do this. You can do this yourself. If you don't have this already, it is, it is just uploading forms and filling in information that you already have. I wouldn't even want to give the information that they're asking for to another person. And there are people out there that will try to charge you for something like this. So, uh, look, anyone that's served in the military, um, you know, you should be able to go in here and fill this out yourself. So, what's next? Probably the most important part of this is where your service disabled veteran-owned small business certification can really move the needle. And it, this works if no other place better than the VA. The Veterans, uh, Administration. Why? Okay, so, with all other federal agencies, I think it's 5%, correct me if I'm wrong, uh, for everyone watching. But, the, uh, I believe it is between, it's either 3 or 5%. I can't remember which one. But, 3 to 5% of all small business, uh, business contracts should go to someone with an SDVOSB certification. And, okay, great. I mean, that's a, that's a percentage. It's about the same for 8a, it's about the same for women-owned small business. But, with the VA, the VA has a Veteran First contracting program. Okay? Now, this is really important. None of the other federal agencies have this. And this is where the real opportunity lies, with the VA, especially for your first government contracts. Um, because the, and I'm just going to read it, so, the, the Veteran First contracting program, under Veteran Benefits, uh, Healthcare and Information Technology Act of 2006, requires the VA to prioritize contracts for verified SDVOSBs and VOSBs, even over other small business programs, like HubZone, 8a, and women-owned small business. The point is, if you are a SDVOSB or VOSB, you are prioritized above everybody else with VA contracts. That's pretty amazing. That gives you an amazing and large advantage. And what you'll see if you look at, and by the way, we can see what the VA spends money on, right? So, again, we don't have to guess. If you have a business, you sell a certain thing, we can go to the VA and see if they even buy it, right? Um, if I go to the VA, if I go to like USAspending.gov, and I look at what, for instance, construction, construction contracts. I'm going to see billions of dollars in construction contracts awarded by the VA, and almost all of them going to service disabled veteran-owned small businesses and veteran-owned businesses, but mainly service disabled veteran-owned small businesses. Now, that's not the case with every industry. Right? Just, probably because service disabled veterans, I think they're less involved, this is now, this is anecdotal, right? This is just me spending a lot of time in government contracts. It seems that service disabled veterans are less involved with white collar companies than blue collar. Uh, that just seems to be the case. But, we're going to look at that here in a little bit. And again, feel free to, uh, throw questions, uh, my way here during the, I'll read them as I get to them. Now, how does Veterans First work with the VA? Well, first, they need to figure out if two or more SDVOSBs or VOSBs can actually do the work. And if there's more to it than that. But, if the answer's yes, then, I believe, they are required to set aside the contract. And that's what, that's what I'm reading right now. It says, if yes, they are required to set aside the contract for SDVOSBs or veteran-owned small businesses, if no service disabled veteran-owned small businesses are available. Again, this is, just getting back to veteran-owned small business versus service disabled veteran-owned small business. I tell people all the time, certain, don't focus on the certifications, right? Focus on your business, provide a great product or solution. But, uh, you know, assuming you have that in place already, the service disabled veteran-owned small business is the certification that moves the needle. VOSB can a little bit. I mean, get it if you qualify for it, but SDVOSB, that is the one that you want. That's the one that really makes a difference. Only if no qualified service disabled veteran-owned small businesses or veteran-owned small businesses are available, do they, they being the VA, consider other small business set-asides or full and open competition. This is different from all other federal agencies, which are allowed, but not required, to use the service disabled veteran-owned small business set-aside under FAR part 19. And the FAR is the Federal Acquisitions Regulations, the really long and boring legal documentation that you have to adhere to. This is what gets lost, uh, often if you're listening to quick sound bites on your favorite social media channel on government contracting. It's a lot more complicated than they make it out to be. People go to jail for breaking these laws. Not often, but they do, right? They can, they can do something and be breaking the law and not even know it. Um, good example is commissions, like working for, just being paid a commission for helping a company win a contract. Or if you're a company, if you're paying your sales team only commissions for contracts that are get closed by the government, you could be breaking the law. So, that's contingent fees in the Federal Acquisitions Regulations. That's just, um, that's just one example. Another example would be, you know, there's a bunch of middlemen nonsense out there. There are also regulations that talk about the percentage of work that has to be performed by the prime. Okay? These are very serious things that we have to follow. Um, and we go much more in depth into those. And I can answer questions on those in separate, uh, broadcast. But, big picture is these programs are here to help certain groups of people, in this case, service disabled veterans. And it moves the needle in no place better than the VA. And by the way, you can use, you can use these benefits, uh, to help you win your first contracts and get a nice foothold in the VA, and then expand to other federal agencies. Because once you sell to the VA, you have past performance, and past performance, meaning you have won and successfully, uh, completed a contract with the U.S. federal government. Once you've done this, it becomes easier to win contracts with other government agencies. You have past performance, it gets your foot in the door. And then, I always tell people, the, the relationship piece is still there when we're selling to federal agencies. It may not seem like it with all of, you know, the, uh, the policy and the regs and the SAM.govs and all of this. But, at the end of the day, there's a live human being in the federal agency, not just one, that are involved with putting you on contract. Sometimes teams of people, hundreds of people. And you've got, I mean, look, you've got program managers, which is what I was in the Air Force. You've got the contracting officer, which is the only person that has a warrant to legally commit funds on behalf of the U.S. government. You have finance people in charge of the different kinds of money. You have engineers that are involved. And then you have leadership, multiple leadership chains, depending on the federal agency. Uh, and a lot of people involved there that you can talk to. You can be a challenge to talk to them sometimes, but we have, uh, some great instruction on that in GovClose.com. If, uh, you're looking to do that. But, you know, you, you start winning these contracts, make sure the government's happy, and they'll keep putting you on contract. SDVOSB certification is a great way to do that. Now, if you're just logging in, this is what we've covered. We've covered what SDVOSB is. Why the government has these set-asides and certifications. We talked about how to know if you qualify for SDVOSB, which basically is you have to be a disabled veteran, anywhere between 0 and 100%. Uh, but you're going to have to have that letter from the VA. You don't have to be over 50%, right? To, like, you have to to get paid. It, any, any percentage. Uh, you have a business, you have to be registered in SAM.gov. We talked and I showed you, and you can re-watch this if you, uh, missed it. I showed you where to apply for the certification, where the checklist are to give you the information. And now we just talked about why selling to the VA, among all the federal agencies, is really the sweet spot and really where you can move the needle. And it's because the other agencies have a small percentage. Uh, they can, they can set something aside for SDVOSB, um, meaning of all the contracts that they are awarding, they might set 3 to 5% of those aside for service disabled veteran-owned small business. But the VA has to look at veteran-owned businesses first, specifically service disabled veteran-owned small businesses. So, if they determine that there's two or more businesses that can provide them help desk services, landscaping services, social media management, augmented reality solution, construction, then they have to set it aside for service disabled veteran-owned small business. Um, if there's not two SDVOSBs, they have to look at veteran-owned small businesses. There's a lot more to this. But the fact that the VA has to, look, it's called the Veterans First program. The Vets First program. Veterans First Contracting Program. I'm not going to read the clause. You guys can look it up. And, uh, because the, look, the VA's mission is, um, serving veterans. And, uh, Congress directed the VA to do this. And to make sure that meaningful opportunities are available for veterans. So, if you are veteran business owner, this is an opportunity. Uh, but, government contracting's not easy. Okay? So, I just still want to, I want to foot stomp this. Even though this program exists, it doesn't mean you're going to win a contract in three weeks. A normal contracting process is 6 to 18 months. That's how long. Are there variations on that? Yeah, sure. There you can, can you get a contract in three months? You can, right? I've awarded a contract in 30 days, but a lot has to be in place in order to do that. Um, let's see here. Oh, hey, Fred, how's it going? Fred, Rick, question for you, with working with the GSA, with GSA, would manufacturers or machine shops being an option for GSA applications, even though it might be outside of the GSA marketplace? Not sure exactly what you're, what you're asking there, Fred. Is it, are you saying that, hey, is GSA an option for manufacturers and machine shops if you're not seeing GSA utilized to make purchases in those areas? And by the way, for everyone on here with the SDVOSB certification questions, this is, uh, and Fred, by the way, Fred's in our Gov Close certification program. He's a Gov Close certified, um, and consulting. He's helping businesses sell to the government. Um, GSA does have a Veterans, uh, have Veterans contracts, uh, that you can look at as well. What I want to do, though, before we, um, close here, I'm going to show you a few more things. I'm also going to show you how to research what the VA is buying. Right? So, you can make a good decision. Okay, so, welcome to the VA Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Portal. So, here, again, this is just a good place for you to go, um, because it will give you, small business training, small business outreach. Highly advise you to go if you have the certification, you might want to go here. Hold on a second here, I'm going to try to, I'm going to try to put the link in the chat for you guys. I'm just going to label this one VA. Okay? It's good, by the way, the reason I like to go to websites like this is because you're meet, now you're meeting some of the people in the VA that are doing this. Right? So, if I have a way, small business training, this could be live, it could be, you know, group training, it could be digital. Um, but small business outreach, um, this connects, uh, veteran-owned and small businesses interested in doing bids with the VA, resources, education, and training. A lot of these have like workshops you can go to. Um, it's just a way to get, to get that relationship going, which I talked about, and is very important. Okay? Um, all right. My favorite. USAspending.gov. Man, how much do I use this website? What are we going to do here? Well, this is, if you are thinking about this, right? Like, hey, if you haven't stuck your nose in the government contracting yet, if you're a veteran, and you're like, all right, Rick, it looks like the SDVOSB certification, I qualify for it. I can apply for it. Looks like it's not a heavy lift. It's not. Again, don't pay anyone to do it for you. Just go to the website I showed you, SBA. You can file, uh, yourself. But, again, there's, there's a lot of work. You get, I mean, you have to register your business in SAM.gov. Um, then you have to get the certification. Then you actually have to go get the contracts, right? Which is a process. Should you even do that? Right? Well, here's the thing. First of all, I'd ask you, do you have a business? If you don't have a business, then you're not selling anything. Right? So, if you're interested in government contracting, and you don't have a business, go to GovClose.com. We'll, we'll teach you the government contracting process, especially if you're a veteran. Now, you can go get those high-paying account executive jobs with companies selling to the government. You can start a consulting business. Um, all of that can lead to you having a government contracting business. But, for those of you that do have a business, hey, I'm a, you know, I just talked to a house painting company. I talked to, uh, which is veteran owned. Um, hey, are they, is the veteran, is the VA spending money there? Um, or maybe you have a, you know, some, a different type of business. Well, this is where we can check it out. So, this is where, okay, I'm at the VA now, and I am, I'm sorry, I'm on the USAspending, and I am going to check and see if the VA spends money in the areas that I'm selling. Because now, if I have that certification, I want to know, or if I'm going to get that certification, I want to know if the VA, which is the primary place to win these SDVOSB contracts, because they have to look at you first. I want to know, am I going to, am I going to be able to use the certification and have an advantage? I just clicked on fiscal years 25, 24, 23, 22. Just 'cause I want to know recent spending. I mean, if I go back to 2008, they might have been buying floppy disks back then and they're not doing it now, right? And then I can go, the easiest way to do this is to try to find a product service code that matches what you do or a NAICS code. Um, so I could go here. You can see they have it in a couple different buckets. Here's a search. Look, they have 2,048 codes. Studies, purchase, natural resources, management, maintenance, repair of building. Let's take a look at that. So, let's say that you are, um, you do something maintaining, repairing, uh, buildings and equipment. So, I just clicked on that. Clicked on these four years. Now I also want to put the agency in. I'm putting the VA in. I'm going to put awarding agency. That's not how you spell Veteran. Department of Veteran Affairs. Okay? And let's take a look and see. How much was spent by the VA? These are all contracts. I do so much, uh, live training on USAspending if you guys are looking at this for the first time. You can go back and look at some of the other videos that we've done. Okay, so, just on that code, over the past three or four years, the VA has spent 3.29 billion dollars. Okay? Now, sorry. I keep doing this, guys. I keep bopping around. I have so many websites open now. Uh, now, we can take a look at how much of this is actually going to service disabled veteran-owned small businesses. That's pretty cool, right? So, of that, I would love to hear what your guesses are. So, this was maintenance and repair of, uh, and rebuilding of equipment. 3.29 billion dollars over the past, what is it? FY25, which we, we don't even know, we're not at the end of fiscal year 25 yet. So, three full years, FY24, 23, 22, and we have part of FY 25. Right, this is the total amount spent, 3.29 billion dollars. Now, I'm going to say, all right, recipient type, I want to go to service disabled veteran-owned small business. How much of that 3.2 billion dollars went to veteran-owned small businesses? This, by the way, this is still total. All right? So, it's just under just under about, almost, 912 million in 24, 844 million. Okay, so this is all businesses. Let's go submit. So, now this is going to tell me how much was awarded to only small businesses with that service disabled veteran-owned small business certification. And that's 870, that's actually less than I thought. 873 million. That's still a lot, but because it's a, what is it? Roughly, a little bit less than a third, maybe maybe a quarter. Um, and then by year, it's showing me 242 million last year, 194 million so far this year. So, if you do, if you're involved with like rebuilding equipment. Again, that's going to cover a lot of different things. But, so we can see, okay, how much are they spending? Now you know, like for service disabled veteran-owned businesses. Uh, and we can do this for any any code. So, or any type of business, right? Provided it has a code associated with it. What if we, what's, let's look at something else here. What about salvage services? I don't know. Salvage services. So, now it's going to just show me the SDVOSB spending. So, if you're in the salvage business, not that much, 5.9 million. Right? So, now I might be thinking, eh, it's going to be worth my time. Because that's over four or five years. Granted, this is just, I don't know how much the VA spends in salvage services in total. Like, if I unclick service disabled veteran, and look at what's the total amount, 7.2. So, they don't spend that much in salvage services. So, again, it may seem like a lot, but that's spread over four or five years and probably not a lot of contracts. Um, let's take a look at something else. Uh, let's see here. So, we looked at salvage services. What about architecture and engineering services? How much does the VA spend? Okay, so they spend 1.8 billion dollars a year on architecture and engineering services, which covers a lot of things. But, again, now you can see what I'm doing here. I'm just going back and forth. All right, 1.8 billion dollars a year, 1.8 billion dollars over the past four years. How about for service disabled veteran-owned businesses? Let's re-put back in the calculator. 1.4. Okay, so, this one, we can see most of this is going to service disabled veteran-owned businesses, right? So, that was 1.8, it was like 1.8 billion dollars for architecture and engineering services. And when we, uh, then put the parameter on, no, just show me the ones that are awarded to SDVOSB, it was 1.5 ish billion dollars awarded. Because remember, the VA has to look at veteran-owned businesses, service disabled veteran-owned businesses, first. Uh, let's see here. All right. Um, yeah, any questions, just throw them in the comments. I know Fred was asking more of a GSA specific question. Uh, and then, Fred, we'll talk, let's talk on the war room call today about that. Uh, specifically with the GSA. And then for everybody on here, this was just a quick. We went over how to see if the VA is actually spending money on whatever it is that you sell. And that's important to help you determine if you want to get that certification, kind of go through this. That's, and the VA and it's important because the VA, that's where the needle is really going to move, because they have to look at SDVOSB and VOSB businesses first. And then they can award them to other companies if there aren't two or more of the SDVOSB or VOSB. So, uh, finally, what we're going to look at is, all right, Rick, how do I find the opportunities for these? And that we're going to go to SAM.gov. Well, that's not good. SAM.gov. I got a 404. Probably because I logged out. Which is fine. SAM.gov, this is where, remember, uh, with registering, if you're going to register your SDVOSB, you do it through SAM.gov. Um, and you have to have a registration in order to apply for the SDVOSB certification. First, you need your business, your LLC paperwork, then you go here, you can register. Um, you're going to register. There's a nice checklist in here, too. Um, here it says, register your entity. Or get a, uh, unique entity. So, you just click get started over there. And, um, it'll walk you through it. It'll give you the checklist. I'm not going to go through that here today. What I am going to show you, what's your best practice for finding some of these opportunities? Well, there's two things you can do, but I always, always want to find out the opportunity as far ahead of the solicitation as possible. If you, if you're just looking for RFPs or solicitations, and here, this is what I mean. We're in, I just clicked search on SAM.gov. Now, I'm going to click contracting. And now I'm going to take a look at the notice type. I can look for a solicitation, right? And then I can look for solicitations that are set aside. And what that means is, all right, um, if it's a solicitation that's set aside for service disabled veteran-owned small business, which I can find right in here. Okay? It's going to give me, this means that, okay, this is due August 7th. This is for construction. It's for the VA. A is for the VA. A is for the VA. This is for the DoD. So, uh, not surprised, first for the VA here. This means I'm going to write a proposal, and if I, they're going to review it, and I could be awarded. But, the way that we win contracts, and the way that, by the way, they have to decide they're going to set something aside. Right? How are they going to do that? It's in the market research phase, and this is the most important part of government contracting. It's the reason things take long. You're not starting with the solicitation. Okay? Very rarely are we. You are starting before this. So, I'm going to unclick that. I want a sources sought. This is where I'm going to tell the VA that I'm an SDVOSB. I'm actually going to, I could get rid of this, too. But, um, so, it looks like these sources sought are actually already, they must already be looking at setting this aside for service disabled veteran-owned small business. But this is where you can reach out to them. Let them know what your business does. Uh, you can let them know things that you think should be in the solicitation that will make you more competitive. This is also where you can tell whatever agency that they, that you're an SDVOSB, um, and that, uh, that you have it and that they can set aside the opportunity or they should, you can recommend. Even if they don't ask, you can recommend that they set it aside for an SDVOSB. You can even go so far as to find another service disabled veteran-owned small business that can do the work and have them submit, too, in order to, uh, give them a little more conjecture. Now, to do that. Now, again, let me get rid of this. With the VA, you're going to have a, uh, a better effect at getting them to set something aside. But with another agency, it's, it's going to be a little bit less effective 'cause they don't have to. They don't have to look at veteran businesses first. This is, this is something that the VA is doing. So, there it is, guys. SDVOSB in a nutshell. Hope everyone got something out of that. Let me know in the comments next time you want a different topic. And we'll see you next time. Cheers. After going through the course, I was able to land a client that pays me a monthly retainer to actually help them develop their business and go out to these federal contracts. I was able to get a consulting gig with a, uh, software company that currently works with the intelligence community. Within two months, I have my first client. So, the initial contract was for a three-month, uh, contract for 4,000 a month. So, 27 years old. You've never worked in government contracting. You've never worked as a consultant, and you just, uh, closed your first deal, is that correct? That's correct. And I got a couple small projects on the side as well, so, um, definitely something, probably the best investment I've made all year. Co-co, landed a nine-figure government contract. Started a consulting business and a high-salaried position as a account executive in public sales. So, could be doing both of those things. I'm living the best of both worlds right now. So, my name is, uh, Mike Nickerbacher. I am a naval officer that's getting ready to retire. Right now, I have three firm clients and two more perspectives. I'm able to provide value across different industries, because the skillset that I learned through the course, was able to apply my own experience. Gov Close came, and it was a no-brainer. I, I wanted some secret sauce. This has allowed me to live in Germany. A little hazy today, but We can do that. You see? Oh, yeah. Dude, that's beautiful. The content, the training, it's invaluable. It's relevant. And, Deb, what motivated you to join the Gov Close certification program? Wow. Well, I think that wanting to work with a leader in the field, someone who understands government contracting on a deep basis and has the reputation, the experience working with you and your company, was a natural. The students that graduate our program, they go on to start their own consulting firms, winning high dollar consulting clients. They go on to land high paying salaried positions as account executives with companies that sell to the government. I'm so proud of the people that have gone through our program. And if you are considering either a job or a business, and by the way, some of our students are doing both, as I did, they're running a consulting business and they'll have an account executive job. It's transforming their lives. It's bringing true wealth to them and their families. Back to the video.",

  "summary": "Rick Howard, a former government acquisitions officer who managed over $82 billion in contracts, introduces the Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) certification program. As the founder of Gov Close, an organization that trains sales executives in small businesses on government contracting, Howard aims to provide comprehensive insights into what the SDVOSB certification entails, who qualifies for it, how to apply, and critically, how to leverage it effectively. This discussion is part of a series on government contracting, with a specific focus on veterans.\n\nThe U.S. federal government is the world's largest buyer of goods and services and is legally mandated to procure a significant portion from small businesses, with the Small Business Administration (SBA) setting annual goals (around 23% or $180 billion last year). Howard explains that while many certifications exist, only a few like the 8a, HubZone, Woman-Owned Small Business, and specifically SDVOSB, truly impact a business's ability to secure government contracts. He emphasizes the distinct advantage of SDVOSB over general Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB) certification, noting that SDVOSB has specific contracting goals and is prioritized by certain federal agencies under initiatives like 'Veterans First'.\n\nHoward provides practical advice, stressing that while SDVOSB can be a powerful tool, it is not an \"easy button\" for contracts; businesses must offer excellent products or services and consider B2B/B2C sales first. He walks through the SDVOSB application process via the SBA website, highlighting that it's straightforward and does not require paying third-party consultants. Key eligibility requirements include being a service-disabled veteran (any percentage), having a registered business, and a SAM.gov registration. The goal is for viewers to make an informed decision on whether to pursue the certification and to utilize it strategically if obtained.",
