    "full_text": "Good evening, I'm William Brangham. Jeff Bennett and Amna Nawaz are away. On the NewsHour tonight, the family of a Palestinian American murdered in the West Bank by Israeli settlers speaks out about his death and the escalating conflict. Rural public media stations face an uncertain future as the Trump administration moves to slash funding. And Canadian tourism to the U.S. drops dramatically in the wake of harsh rhetoric from the president.\nI have many U.S. friends, American friends that I will not be seeing in person for a while because of this. But that's c'est la vie, as we say here in Quebec.\n\nMajor funding for the PBS NewsHour has been provided by:\n\nThe Judy and Peter Bloom Kovler Foundation, upholding freedom by strengthening democracies at home and abroad.\n\nThe Ford Foundation, working with visionaries on the front lines of social change worldwide.\n\nThe Walton Family Foundation, working for solutions to protect water during climate change so people and nature can thrive together.\n\nSupported by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, committed to building a more just, verdant, and peaceful world. More information at macfound.org.\n\nAnd with the ongoing support of these institutions.\n\nThis program was made possible by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and by contributions to your PBS station from viewers like you.\nThank you.\n\nWelcome to the NewsHour. There's word that some Syrian military units are withdrawing from the southern city of Suwayda tonight after days of deadly fighting. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced today that all parties, including Israel, agreed to a ceasefire. But the day began with Israeli strikes in Syria's capital, part of an operation that Israel claimed was to protect a minority group within Syria that it considers an ally.\n\u0634\u0628\u0627\u0628 \u0641\u064a \u0639\u0646\u062f\u0646\u0627 \u0642\u0635\u0641. \u0634\u0628\u0627\u0628 \u0641\u064a \u0639\u0646\u062f\u0646\u0627 \u0642\u0635\u0641.\nToday, the heart of Damascus, shaken by huge explosions.\n\u0642\u0635\u0641 \u0634\u062f\u064a\u062f.\nSeveral were captured live on TV. Including this one, reposted online by Israel's Defense Minister with his message, the painful blows have begun. The Israeli strikes targeted the headquarters of Syria's defense ministry. Another hit the hills near the presidential palace. Israel is scaling up its intervention as unrest in southern Syria continues to rage. The conflict started in Suwayda, where back and forth kidnappings and other attacks between Bedouin tribes and Druze militias escalated this week, prompting the Syrian government to send troops into the predominantly Druze region. A UK-based war monitoring group estimates more than 250 people have been killed.\nThe Syrian government tried to mediate between the Druze and these Bedouin tribes.\nJames Jeffrey is a former envoy to Syria during the first Trump administration.\nThe problem is their own troops are as ill-disciplined as the various militias that they're trying to uh get between, and that led to shooting on all sides and a very unclear situation and a very dangerous one because it involves outside powers, in this case, Israel.\nToday, Israel vowed to continue its attacks until Syria withdraws its forces from Suwayda.\n\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u062a\u0631\u0633\u064a\u0645 \u0634\u0644\nOur interests in Syria are known. First, to maintain the status quo in the southern Syrian region. The second thing, to prevent harm to the Druze community, with which we have a bold and strong relationship with the Druze citizens here in Israel.\n\u05d6\u05d9\u05dd \u05db\u05d0\u05df \u05d1\u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc\nSince the fall of Assad, Israel has launched hundreds of strikes on military sites in Syria and seized much of the Golan Heights border region. Israel sees the Druze as a loyal minority. Many of those in Israel serve in the Israeli military.\n\u0628\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0645 \u0646\u0641\u062f\u064a\u0643 \u064a\u0627 \u0633\u0648\u062f\u0627\nToday, hundreds of them crowded at the border to protest the violence in Suwayda. Some even crossed into Syria.\nI have especially a big family there, that they suffer a lot there. They have been killed and it's hard for us to stand here, not doing anything.\nThere are splits within the Druze themselves, but a prominent Druze faction has vowed to continue fighting despite today's ceasefire. The UN Security Council will address the conflict tomorrow.\nAlso in the Middle East, an American aid organization in Gaza says 20 Palestinians died in a crowd surge at one of its distribution sites today. It's the first time the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has reported deaths at one of its locations. The injured were rushed to a hospital in the southern city of Khan Yunis. The GHF says 19 people were trampled and one was fatally stabbed. It blames Hamas for stirring chaos but provided no evidence. Witnesses say guards caused panic when they closed the gates to the site, trapping the crowd in a narrow entrance.\n\u0643\u0644 \u0648\u0627\u062d\u062f \u0648\u0627\u0642\u0641 \u0645\u0646\u0647\u0645 \u0628\u0628\u0627\u0631\u0648\u062a\u0647\nEach one of them was standing with their weapons and standing watching us, firing pepper spray at us while we were suffocating, and they pushed us down.\nAlso today, Gazans mourned the lives lost in the latest round of Israeli airstrikes. Health authorities say at least 54 people were killed across the territory, including more than a dozen children. Israel says it targets only Hamas fighters and blames them for operating in residential areas. Meantime, in Israel, a second vital partner in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition is quitting the government, leaving him with a minority in parliament. The ultra-Orthodox Shas party said today it's against a proposed law that would require its supporters to serve in the military. They've long been exempt from military service. Shas says it would not push to dissolve Netanyahu's government, but it's the second ultra-Orthodox party to quit this week over the same issue of military service.\nUkrainian officials say at least 15 people were injured after Russia launched attacks overnight on four cities. That included Vinnytsia in western Ukraine, where firefighters were still battling blazes by morning. Ukraine's Air Force says Russia launched 400 drones and a ballistic missile as it ramps up an aerial campaign ahead of a new September deadline set by President Trump to reach a ceasefire. The US has pledged to send more weapons to Ukraine and threatens sanctions if the Kremlin can't reach a peace deal.\nHere at home, President Trump lashed out at his own supporters today over his administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case. Appearing alongside the Crown Prince of Bahrain, Trump blamed, quote, some stupid Republicans for siding with Democrats over what he called a big hoax. Earlier on social media, he wrote, \"Let these weaklings continue forward and do the Democrats' work because I don't want their support anymore.\" Last week, the Justice Department and the FBI said that no more files would be made public about the deceased sex offender, which enraged a portion of the president's base.\nThe Department of Homeland Security confirms that it sent five immigrants it says were convicted of serious crimes to the African nation of Eswatini. Officials say they are from Vietnam, Cuba, Yemen, Jamaica, and Laos, and were convicted of various crimes, including murder, burglary, and raping a minor. The move comes after the Supreme Court last month lifted restrictions on such third-country deportations. The Eswatini government said the men are being held in isolated units and that they will ultimately be sent back to their home countries.\nOn Wall Street today, stocks ended higher after President Trump denied reports that he's moving closer to firing Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added more than 200 points, or about half a percent. The Nasdaq rose about 50 points on the day. The S&P 500 also ended in positive territory.\nAnd the largest piece of Mars ever found here on Earth has sold at auction for more than $5 million when counting fees. The 54-pound chunk was discovered in Niger in the Sahara Desert in 2023. It had been blown off the surface of Mars by a massive asteroid strike and traveled some 140 million miles to Earth. The sale was part of an auction of rare geological and archaeological objects in New York, which also saw a juvenile dinosaur skeleton sell for more than $30 million.\nStill to come on the NewsHour, new legislation aims to create a more stable environment for cryptocurrency, but questions remain. An Idaho farmer pushes back on immigration raids and argues for a new look at immigration policy. And a symphony honors the passage of marriage equality as its future is increasingly in doubt.\n\nThis is the PBS NewsHour from the David M. Rubenstein studio at WETA in Washington and in the West from the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism at Arizona State University.\n\nThere's been a surge of attacks on Palestinians by Israeli settlers, and on Friday, a 20-year-old Palestinian American was beaten to death in the West Bank. Saifullah Musallet is now the fifth American to be killed in the occupied West Bank by Israeli forces or settlers since the war in Gaza began. As Stephanie Sy reports, the U.S. is now demanding accountability.\nAllahu Akbar!\nThe body of a Florida native lifted above a throng of mourners in the West Bank. The scene Sunday, one all too familiar in the Palestinian territories. A procession of pain for the latest victims of Israeli settler violence. A family friend closes the eyelids of Palestinian-American Saifullah Kamal Musallet. He was only 20 and worked at his father's ice cream shop in Tampa. He'd been in the West Bank for a few weeks for a family visit. Last Friday, more than two dozen masked Israeli settlers attacked the nearby town of Sinjil,\n\u0627\u0637\u0644\u0639 \u0627\u0637\u0644\u0639 \u0627\u0637\u0644\u0639 \u0627\u0637\u0644\u0639\nburning fields, throwing rocks, and taking lives. Musallet was beaten to death while protecting his family's land.\nRelatives say settlers and Israeli soldiers prevented ambulances from reaching Saif for some three hours.\nKilled in the same attack, 23-year-old Palestinian, Muhammad Razek Hussein al-Shalabi, Saif's friend. He was found dead in an olive grove, shot in the chest. A relative blamed Israeli policies for his loss.\n\u0647\u064a \u062c\u0631\u064a\u0645\u0647 \u0645\u062a\u0643\u0631\u0631\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u064a\u0627\u0633\u0647 \u0645\u062a\u0643\u0631\u0631\u0647\nIt's a continuous crime and continuous policy of the occupation to try and force Palestinians to leave their land. The whole world is witnessing this crime, which all Palestinians are suffering from.\nMore Palestinians were injured last month in settler attacks than in any month over the last two decades, according to the U.N. And there have been over 700 settler attacks just this year on Palestinians or their properties, nearly a 15% increase from the same time last year. The town of Sinjil, where the killings occurred Friday, has been tense since Israeli forces began erecting a 16-foot-high barbed wire fence around the town in late April, reportedly cutting locals off from their lands and livelihoods. But a stronger statement came from American Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, posting on X. A longtime staunch supporter of Israel, the ambassador asked for an aggressive investigation into what he called Musallet's murder, adding, \"There must be accountability for this criminal and terrorist act.\"\nSince the war in Gaza began, five Americans have been killed in the West Bank. No one has faced prosecution in any of the killings.\nI'm joined now by Saifullah Musallet's cousin, Nizar Milbis, who is currently in Ramallah in the West Bank. Nizar, first of all, thank you for joining us, and I'm so sorry for the loss of your cousin. Um, tell me what you know about what happened on Friday night, where Saif was, and what happened leading up to his death.\nSo, uh, for the last several weeks, the Israeli settlers have been, um, encroaching on, um, on our lands, uh, destroying property, and uh, so, you know, our our town Al-Mazra'a ash-Sharqiya, um, is a town that has about 65% uh, American citizens. Uh, Saif was uh, attempting to access his, his his land. There's been coordinated uh, ambushes by, by, by settlers that have encroached on the land and, and he basically was, uh, was attacked, uh, you know, just basically trying to access his land.\nTell me what the family is going through right now.\nI mean, they're, they're obviously devastated and profoundly sad, but you know, they have very strong faith. Um, they believe that this is God's will. But obviously they're very devastated. You know, he was a few weeks away from his 21st birthday. Um, you know, he was full of life. Um, you know, and uh, he was, he was just an amazing young man. He was very, very, very had a very precious, kind, loving soul. Uh, that you'll ever meet, uh, very well mannered, raised with profound morals. Um, you know, he was a normal American young man, loved baseball. Uh, was uh, was a huge Tampa Bay Rays uh, fan, actually had just went to a game with his uncle prior to arriving. And you know, they're devastated.\nI wonder if you'll go into how much recent Israeli security operations, especially in Sinjil and that area have affected, um, livelihoods and sort of the overall sense of, of access, um, to one's land in that area.\nYou know, the, the Israeli's army, um, frequents the area. They're really there to protect the settlers. Um, and so, you know, a lot of people are intimidated. Uh, there's there's not too much, there's a lack of trust with, with, uh, the communities out here, um, because they feel really just, just abandoned.\nHundreds of Palestinians have been killed in West Bank violence and settler attacks, um, in just the last few years, and the attacks have been escalating. Um, but when an American is killed overseas, it's expected more will be done to seek justice. Do you and the family have that expectation and what should the US and Americans be doing?\nAs much as we trust in, in, in that the, the American government, uh, is there to protect the citizens, it's, it's, it's ultimately failed. Um, we hope that this time it's different. Um, you know, we've, we've we've uh, gotten a call from the ambassador, uh, to the, uh, US ambassador to Israel, that promised an investigation. Um, but fell short from guaranteeing, uh, that he will, um, have the American law enforcement themselves, uh, uh, be part of the investigation. So we're, we're we're not too optimistic.\nAnd is there anything else that you would say Americans, um, can do from afar to support you or your family?\nThe best thing to do right now is for Americans to, um, demand an investigation. Unfortunately, uh, if you look at the statistics, only 3% of uh, settler attacks have ever had any any any results of of prosecutions for the for the perpetrators. Um, so we're we we we hope that this time is different. Um, given that the circumstances of his death, uh, the fact that he was beaten, um, and you know, he was unarmed and he was basically just on his land. There was, there was no confrontation. He wasn't attacking anybody. And, uh, we just, we just hope that this time, uh, the outcome is different.\nNizar Milbis, thank you so much for joining us um on the NewsHour and sorry again for your loss.\nThank you for having me.\n\nAmong the programs targeted for cuts in this rescissions package is the Corporation for Public Broadcasting or CPB. It's the independent nonprofit created by Congress to distribute federal funds to non-commercial TV and radio stations across the U.S. Today, it funds more than 1,500 public stations, many of which produce local news, music shows, but also buy national content from NPR and PBS. Collectively, public media stations give 99% of the U.S. access to public broadcasting. Nearly 250 of those stations are considered rural stations. Joining us to discuss what's at stake with these potential cuts is Tom Abbott. He's the general manager of KFSK, the public radio station based in Petersburg, Alaska. So, Tom Abbott, tell us a little bit about, about your community and the station and and who you serve.\nWell, KFSK is located uh in the central part of the Southeast Panhandle of Alaska. We're on the, we're on the coast of British Columbia, uh on an island. Uh we're accessible by air or boat only. Uh it's primarily a commercial fishing fleet here with uh, a population of 3,400. And we have a 24/7 service that provides companionship to people, vital news and information, uh broadcasting assembly meetings live, school board meetings, hospital board meetings, um and then there's the lighthearted uh just everyday things of who's celebrating a birthday today.\nI know you also do local news, national news, uh, you also play an important role with regards to public safety. Can you explain that?\nin the event of an emergency, we are the one that is gonna receive the alert whether it's coming from a national source, a state source, a regional source or if it's local, we're the ones that are firing it off. And then we become the public information officer in the event of that emergency to relay the pertinent and important information to the public from the first responders of whatever that emergency may be. And recently it was about two years ago on a Halloween evening when there was, we'd had a week of heavy rain, and the mountainside here had a slide, a landslide on it and it blocked off the one road that we have, cutting the island in half. We were the ones on the air that night telling people to stay clear of that area while the workers were there clearing the rubble.\nIf these cuts go through coming out of Washington D.C., what does that mean for your ability to do all of these things you're describing?\nWell, it's going to make it very difficult uh for us to continue providing a meaningful local so- local service here because 30% of our budget comes from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, 60% of our budget is our personnel cost. Uh the other things that are sort of static expenses that we can't do without paying the electricity bill, uh, you know, the, the heating in the wintertime, the upkeep of the building, the upkeep of the broadcast equipment, it's all very expensive. And those are pretty much sort of a static budget.\nYou're in Alaska, which is because of the sparse geographic nature and people spread out, public radio and TV are particularly important, but you're also there's other parts of the country in the south and the west that are very much the same. What is the argument that you make if someone asks you as to why should we be funding public media?\nI will take anyone on a tour of this area and you will go to blank spots or dead spots where there is no cell phone coverage here. And it's not very far. It can just be as matter of three miles away and the FM signal is delivered to that area, but the the cell phone coverage is dead in that spot.\nYou live in a community that is that Republicans outnumber Democrats quite a bit, and there has been an allegation that Republicans largely make that public media is is biased and taxpayers shouldn't support it. I know that's been an issue with regards to donations for your own station. How do you respond to that critique?\nWell, I like to sit down and and talk with people one-on-one and hopefully, you know, have a, have a good conversation about that because sometimes they're they've got a point. Um and I'll I'll grant them that. There have been times where I I could see their their opinion on it or their point of view on a particular piece. Overall, it's very good reporting. Uh I believe that it's the best service we can provide here. We've had uh, uh, tremendous support in this community. I mean, you know, it was two to one that voted for uh, Trump over Harris in this most recent presidential election. But it's about two to one that also support KFSK as far as a conservative or a liberal goes. The service that we provide is vitally important, and that's why I think we do get support.\nTom Abbott, General Manager of KFSK in Alaska. So great to talk to you. Thank you very much for your time.\nThank you.\n\nMore Canadians come to uh, come to America than tourists from any other country. Last year, Canadians made over 20 million visits to the U.S. and spent more than $20 billion here. But this year, many are not coming to America. As I saw firsthand on a recent trip to Vermont, right near the Canadian border.\nIn a normal summer, the Kingdom trails in Vermont's Northeast Kingdom near the Quebec border would be teaming with Canadian bikers. But executive director Abby Long says this season has been a rough ride.\nWe have seen a 50% decline in our Canadian members.\n25 miles away at Hill Farmstead Brewery, business is off by a third.\nWe just had a large festival last weekend, and 50 or 60 of the ticket holders just did not come.\nLast year, 20 million Canadians visited the U.S. That's over a quarter of all the tourists who come here. But in June, car crossings to America dropped by 33%. That's the sixth consecutive month of decline. Air travel has also plummeted. So why are Canadians staying away?\nFrankly, Canada should be the 51st state.\nMost offensive to northern neighbors like Julie Morrison has been President Trump's rhetoric.\nThis threat of annexation by, you know, this uh, very powerful, militarized ally, we took it very, very seriously. And honestly, it's frightening.\nMorrison has happy memories of her many American vacations, but now she's staying home.\nWe don't have a lot of tools. And well, tourism is one of the tools that we have.\nI feel that I've been slapped across the face by this president.\nQuebecer Harold White has vacationed in Maine for the last six decades. This year, he canceled his annual trip.\nAnd I have many US friends, American friends that I will not be seeing in person for a while because of this. But that's c'est la vie as we say here in Quebec.\nJay Peak is a mountain resort just a few miles south of the border. In wintertime, typically half their season pass holders are Canadian, most of them French-speaking Quebecois. That's clear even in summertime.\nThe signage that we have here is mostly all bilingual.\nGeneral Manager Steve Wright has proof,\nI have uh, the Maple Leaf here.\nthat the bonds here run deep.\nMy dad is Canadian.\nLiterally in your blood.\nBig connection, not just the dollars and the cents, but the uh the DNA.\nEven so, as the ski season wound down here and it came time to renew, many longtime Canadian season pass holders said, \"Non.\"\nWe are 30 to 35% off.\nAnd you're sure that this is overall their antipathy to what's coming out of the White House.\nWell, yeah, as much as I guess you can be sure of anything. Um I called 100 households myself, Canadian households who had purchased season passes last year by this point, who have not yet purchased.\nYou call them directly?\nI called them directly, personally. I got through to probably 70% of them. And to a household, they referred back to the 51st state narrative as being emblematic of the reason that they're not coming.\nOther areas of the resort have also been hit.\nWe've already seen 30% of our Canadian golf groups cancel. We do 42 weeks worth of hockey tournaments. We're expecting that business to be off upwards of 40% by the end of the year.\nTourism across this northern part of Vermont is dependent on Canadians, yet they are nowhere to be found.\nNormally, the Vermont highways in summertime are full of cars with Canadian license plates. Here we are in summer, on the road, we haven't seen any.\nTheir absence affects even non-tourism businesses.\nWhat's devastating is when they come, there's an economic impact to our community.\nTowns will benefit.\nSure, because they eat and shop and sleep and...\nGallons of maple syrup.\nAt Hill Farmstead Brewery, the Canadian beer enthusiasts who have come this year have spent less.\nThe tariff situation means that someone buying beer from us just coming for the day, they'll pay not just the provincial tax, but they will now pay a 25% additional tariff. They're paying 43% above cost to bring beer back.\nWow.\nAnd that has...\nI mean, your beer is delicious, but I'm sorry, that might be a real deterrent.\nIt is a real deterrent.\nAnd it's not just Americans who are feeling the pinch. Just steps across the U.S.-Canada border in Quebec, Philippe Bachand's duty-free shop should be bustling this time of year.\nBut uh right now, it's very disappointing.\nBachand says Canadian business is down close to 50%. For now, he's squeaking by.\nWe did not lay off anybody, but it's, we need to to be careful in ordering and all that.\nBut smaller duty-free shops along the border are on the brink.\nFour to six store are planning to if it's going on, they will close by the by fall.\nTo close for good.\nYeah. Yeah, yeah, after 30, 40 years of a of existence. We're here on the border with our little white flag, and it's not because of bad management that we're in this situation. It's because of politics.\nIn Burlington, Vermont, outdoor store owner Mike Donahue says they're doing what they can to entice their northern neighbors to return.\nChurch Street, which is the pedestrian marketplace, is being renamed Rue Canada or Canada Street to show our solidarity with our Canadian neighbors.\nAt Kingdom Trails, Abby Long has her own idea.\nFree mountain bike day, Free Canada Day, where we shout to the rooftops how much we love them and encourage them to come. And if they do choose to come, they'll be a day in their honor, a free day.\nJay Peak offers so-called at-par pricing.\nWe price obviously all of our products in US currency, but we allow Canadians to buy in Canadian currency, so they get the benefit of the exchange.\nBut all these efforts may not be enough. Canadian Harold White is spending his money elsewhere.\nI'm just back from a lovely trip to Spain, and my wife and I went on a five-hour drive east of Quebec City, in the mountains, off the St. Lawrence River. It's a trip that we would not necessarily have done if we had gone to the U.S. for our usual vacation.\nCanadian Julie Morrison grew up going to Vermont.\nMy family has owned property uh in Vermont all my life.

For the PBS NewsHour, I'm William Brangham in Northern Vermont.\n\nIt is a big week for the crypto industry as Congress could pass a series of bills that would be the first to regulate this booming business. Cryptocurrencies are a form of payment and an asset class which are created, used, and stored electronically. They do not rely on any bank or government for their value. Our Lisa Desjardins explains.\nTwo key bills are up for votes. The Genius Act regulates stable coins, what some see as the least risky digital assets because they're backed by real world assets like dollars. That would mean mainstream banks could increasingly use stable coins. The other bill, the Clarity Act, regulates digital currency and assets overall, splitting oversight between the securities and exchange commission and the commodities futures trading commission. To help us understand what this legislation would do and its impact, we're joined now by two guests. Patrick McHenry is the former chair of the House Committee on Financial Services and is now an adviser to financial companies, including some investing in crypto. And, Hillary Allen is a professor of law at American University and author of FinTech Dystopia. Thanks to you both. Chairman McHenry, I want to start with you. Basically everyone wants regulation of this industry. You helped write the Clarity Act when you were in Congress, an initial version of it, to spark innovation. But this is a very fast moving industry, trillions of dollars at stake, um, and it's confusing to a lot of Americans as well as increasingly tied to our economy. My question to you is, how does this bill make sure that the industry stays in check?\nWell, first, it defines what is a digital asset. Right now you have the innovators or fraudulent actors defining what they call a digital asset or a cryptocurrency. We need clarity under federal law. The Europeans have it, the Japanese have it. Most countries around the world have already defined this thing that's been around for 15 years. Um, and the United States is a follower here, not a leader in regulating digital assets. So we need clarity of what it is. We need a means of exchange just like we have with securities, just like we have with commodities. And we need a rules-based regime of how these things will be regulated. That's what the Clarity Act does, and it is a great first step in us regulating uh this innovation.\nHillary, you're not a fan of digital currency and assets as they stand right now, and you actually see this legislation as dangerous. Why?\nWell to say that this was unregulated beforehand, I think mischaracterizes the issue. Most crypto assets fit within the traditional securities law framework, and most stable coins fit within the traditional banking law framework. There's been a choice not to enforce those laws and instead put in place these lighter touch regimes that legitimize the the crypto assets by giving them a patina of regulation, but actually leave the American public worse off than they were before under the existing regulatory regimes.\nYou heard that, Mr. Chairman. Is this a patina of regulation that actually sort of just leaves a lot of loopholes for the industry?\nNo. We had four years of the Biden administration trying to kill uh cryptocurrency and crypto generally, and were unsuccessful at doing that. They lost in the courts and the regulators were ineffective at ensuring consumer protections here. So now Congress has to step in, provide rule of law and clarity under law, which has been lacking.\nHillary Allen, what about those arguments that the US is behind here in regulating this industry? That without more from Congress that there will be further problems, both for the industry and for those anyway connected to it. Um, and that it's time to at least get something going here.\nWell, to suggest that this law will create perfect clarity about the the legal status of these assets, I think is is silly. This law ties the definition of these assets to a moving target of a particular technology, which is going to evolve over time. And in fact, we had a decent amount of clarity beforehand. There was a degree of certainty that these crypto assets, including meme coins were securities regulated through the investor protection regimes that has stood us in good stead since the 1930s. It's just not the clarity that the industry wanted.\nChairman McHenry, we know the industry obviously has invested a lot in conversations about what this law should look like. Um, what to that argument that it is the industry that pushed the way this regulation ended up and did not want the SEC regulating it?\nWell, the decision we made last Congress under uh my leadership in the House, uh of the committee I chaired, uh was to actually give the Securities and Exchange Commission uh part of the powers. Our attempt there was to bring clarity under law and make that divide between what is a commodity, what is a security, and what is a stable coin, and define it. This seems like a sensible thing to do, whether or not you like the technology, uh or hate it. Uh it should be separate from ideology and should just be a practical uh conversation which has largely has been. A bipartisan debate on how to best regulate this thing that has been around for 15 years, uh but the United States has been woefully behind in providing clarity under law.\nJust in our last minute or so, I want to ask both of you, what should people understand about this industry? And starting with you, Hillary, um, you see risks.\nI think you should know that this regulation or these laws are broadly deregulatory, not just for the crypto industry, but for traditional finance as well. And they are taking us to the bad old days of the 1920s. I think you should also know that most Americans do not own crypto, that most Americans have a vastly unfavorable opinion of crypto, and that this industry has absolutely driven this legislation. And when we hear of bipartisan support, that bipartisan support is not coming because voters want it, it's coming because vast amounts of money were expended by the crypto industry in the 2024 election cycle, 44% of all corporate expenditures on that election cycle.\nAnd Mr. Chairman?\nUh this technology is here to stay. Uh Bitcoin is 15 years old. Ethereum will be 10 years old uh at the end of this month. Uh this innovation is here to stay. For those that are in opposition of crypto, they're howling at the moon for rising. They're against technology and the deployment of new technology. Um and what we're trying to provide here is a balanced approach so this innovation can happen here and can flourish here just like the internet did. 1.0 and 2.0 happened because United States got it right in regulatory policy uh and the deployment of that technology. That's what's going to happen here with digital assets, and this is going to be a great societal good over the long term and an innovation that will be powerful and helpful, especially in balancing the forces of artificial intelligence uh that is going to come uh to society very soon.\nWell, this was an exhilarating and important discussion. Hillary Allen and Patrick McHenry. Thank you to you both.\nThanks for having us.\nThank you.\n\nPresident Trump's aggressive immigration enforcement is being felt across the country. Immigration arrests have gone up in every state and more than doubled in 38 states. The biggest increase is happening in Idaho, where since January 20th, ICE has made more than 300 arrests. One Idaho farmer, Shay Myers, who grows onions and other vegetables, is speaking out on behalf of his immigrant workforce.\nI know the the undocumented workers that we're talking about deporting because I grew up in a small farming town. I went to school with kids that were undocumented. My kids go to school in a small town with kids who may not be documented. If we're going to do things the right way, we need to think about the human, ethical side of mass deportation.\nAnd farmer Shay Myers joins me now. Um, Shay, thank you so much for being here. You voted for President Trump. He was very clear during his campaign that he would do the things that he is now doing on immigration. But you have been critical of some of these policies. I I'm curious as to why you chose to speak out.\nYeah, William, thanks for having me on. I I I chose to speak out because it's wrong. Um, it's wrong for the people who have been here for decades, decades upon decades and who contribute on a daily basis to every aspect of the US economy, every aspect of the US culture. They're an important part of who we are.\nBut that message, what you're saying in the Republican party in particular, is not that's not a common theme that you hear.\nThat is true. It isn't a common theme. I think but and in a lot of ways, whether it's left or right, whether it's Democrat or Republican, there's a very, very big, um, misunderstanding about what it means to be an immigrant in the United States, what it means to be a falsely documented immigrant in the United States. And so, it really the message needs to be spread to everyone so that they can understand it. And certainly the right-wing Republicans have a hard time understanding, many of them, the reality of the contribution that immigrants play in the United States, and the role they play on our farms, and in our factories, and in our hotels, and in every aspect of the culture. But, you know, the only thing we can do is to try and speak up and speak out.\nAmongst the the immigrant workforce that you have, do you hear from them about, I mean, how are they feeling in this moment seeing the news of these arrests around the country?\nYou know, they're they're frustrated, um, they're they're scared, but more than anything, they're, they're feeling like they're being judged in a way that they never have before. Just, just a few years ago, uh, during the middle of COVID, they were deemed to be essential workers, essential to the survival of our country. Right? And we were praising farm workers for what they do and the contribution that they made and the food that they provided us. And all of a sudden, they're like criminals, right? And and so they've suddenly found themselves in a place where they don't, that they're they're losing their footing and they don't understand why the harsh judgment when such a short time ago, they were so important.\nThe president at one point sort of citing what you're exactly talking about, floated the idea of not targeting farm workers, though his ag secretary, Brooke Rollins recently said that's not the case. What would you like to see done about immigration reform in this country?\nYou know, I mean, in that aspect, President Trump is right. Um, and and and Brooke Rollins didn't say that there wasn't a path to citizenship. What she was saying is there wasn't amnesty. And I agree with both of those sides. As an advocate for immigrants, I I want them to be able to feel comfortable to be able to do their job, to to to be here in this country because they have done the right thing, um, in contributing to our to our economy and and and and to our culture and to our society. But at the same time, we can't just give them, you know, their citizenship. And and the idea that someone who has proven that they've worked in the United States for several years, that they've been contributing, um, and and paying taxes and participating, um, in that way, should have a way to get a legal working status to be here in the United States. And that's partially because if we don't have them, then we don't provide the food for people in this country. And that's the part that people miss. We we snap our fingers and every, every immigrant, undocumented worker is gone from this country, we will not eat in this country. And it sounds like an exaggeration, but it is not. We will not eat. We will starve if tomorrow we said, \"Hey, all of you that are illegal, you're not going to work. You're you're out of the fields and you're out of the country, we will not eat.\nI hear everything you're saying, but let's just say you decided to hang up your farmer's hat and run for office in your own Republican Party. You know you don't have a chance even getting through a primary talking like that. How do we fix that?\nYou know, I'm not sure that in this world anymore, I I I I hope that I do. Now, as a Republican, I'm not going to win. You're not incorrect there. But I think as a common sense, um, citizen of this country, if I came to people, I think there's enough people from the center uh of the aisle, um, from both sides, whether they're a Republican or a Democrat, that they would listen to what I had to say and they would understand it because, you know, on the on the far left, I have I have problems and on the far right, I have problems, but in the middle, there's a lot of people that understand that we need to fix this and we need to fix it badly for the for the economics of the country and and for the ethics of the people.\nIn addition to being what sounds like a very successful farmer, you also have a great social media presence and you sometimes turn your social media over to some of those immigrant workers. Let's hear a little bit from one of those clips.\nEvery time you see food on your table, every time you see a or you enjoy a really good steak, you should think about immigration as good. Those jobs that sometimes you don't think about it, we are grateful for this country. Immigrants shouldn't mean bad.\nThat appeal to both see the connections between our food and the immigrants who help produce it is clearly, as you've been saying, meant to humanize the people who are in this country helping us. Who are you trying to speak to putting those voices out there?\nYou know, I'm trying to speak to the human heart is really what I'm trying to speak to. Like, we we all need, um, to understand the contribution that these folks make and the necessity that we have, um, as an economy, as a country to have them here. And immigrants have been part of our system since the beginning of our country. They have come, they have contributed, and they have made a difference both for themselves and to lift up and improve our country. And it's it's a they're a necessary part of everything. And I just want everyone to realize that that is the case, and they're real people.\nShay Myers, farmer from Idaho, thank you so much for your time. Really appreciate it.\nI appreciate you having me.\n\n10 years ago, marriage equality became the law of the land. In the landmark case Obergefell v. Hodges, the Supreme Court ruled that state bans on same-sex marriage violated the 14th Amendment. Jeffrey Brown went to the Washington National Cathedral to see how a new symphonic piece honors the love story of plaintiff Jim Obergefell and his husband John, and how the fight to preserve that law continues today. It's part of our arts and culture series, Canvas.\n\nSupreme Court cases don't usually engender a piece of symphonic music, but Obergefell v. Hodges was no ordinary case. So, the joyous and exuberant sounds of John and Jim.\nThere's what I've realized, for me is the musical embodiment of champagne bubbles. And my late husband John loved champagne. So whenever I hear that section, that's really when I feel John the most.\nJim is Jim Obergefell. John was John Arthur, his longtime partner, diagnosed with ALS in 2011. In July 2013, as John was dying, they traveled to Maryland, a state that allowed gay marriage, to be wed. But Ohio, where they lived, banned same-sex marriages, and Jim learned he wouldn't be recognized as John's spouse upon his death.\nWe had to figure out where to go to do something millions of other people took for granted. But we made it happen.\nFighting that led to the court case, one that changed American life.\nOh, perfect.\nSince then, nearly 600,000 gay and lesbian couples have wed. And a May poll showed 68% of Americans support marriage equality.\nJohn and Jim was written by composer Viet Cuong, originally for the Pride Bands Alliance, and first performed last summer in Ohio. At the Cathedral, the National Orchestra Institute premiered a new symphonic version. For Cuong, here with his husband, Trevor Rudge, this was a very personal project.\nI think the most important thing I wanted to show in the piece was love, 'cause love is universal. And uh, and also humanize this Supreme Court decision that people know as Obergefell v. Hodges.\nHumanize a Supreme Court decision, right?\nYeah, 'cause it started with their story.\nIt's a legal thing, but you're making it\nYeah.\npersonal.\nYeah.\nYeah. And I didn't want to be apologetic about it being a love story between two men who loved each other.\nYou didn't want to be apologetic, meaning...\nI didn't want to have a metaphor for the title, or hide hide what it's about.\nTo thread that musical needle, Cuong turned to an old wedding favorite, Pachelbel's Canon.\nWhen I was young, I would play the baseline of the Pachelbel Canon on the piano and I started to improvise melodies with the right hand on top of it. And that was how I started to compose music. And so uh, it was around that time when I was a kid that I started to, you know, grow up and I realized I was gay. And I remember seeing on TV the Pachelbel Canon used for wedding music. And it made me sad that this music that I loved was like so emblematic of something that I felt was wrong with me, and something that I could never have. Like, I could never be married in that way. And so, in this piece, I I call it interpolating the music. Um\nInterpolating?\nYeah, kind of like rewriting it in a way I felt like I was kind of um reframing that music and kind of reclaiming it.\nJim Obergefell says he cries no matter how many times he hears the work.\nAnd how does he feel today, thinking back to John and the court case?\nSurreal is the best word I can come up with. It's still honestly surprises me that I was part of this that our marriage inside a medical jet on an airport tarmac became part of this landmark civil rights case. It still doesn't feel possible. In fact, I have to remind myself when I see Obergefell referenced in a news story, or or I hear someone say Obergefell, I really have to remind myself that they're talking about me.\nHe also knows firsthand how much that history has meant to others.\nI was in Cincinnati, and at an event on the steps of the courthouse in Cincinnati, and before the event began, a man came up to me and shook my hand and thanked me, and as he started to cry, he said, \"Thank you, Jim. Because of you, I know my son can marry whomever it is that he loves.\" I had a young woman tell me that marriage equality, this decision, a lawsuit saved her life. She was planning to commit suicide because as a closeted queer kid, she did not see a future for herself.\nEven amid the 10-year anniversary celebrations, Obergefell sees new threats to gay marriage, amid calls for the Supreme Court to overturn the historic decision, as it did with Roe v. Wade.\nI take those threats very seriously, and I start with the Supreme Court. We have two sitting Supreme Court justices who have made it clear that they want to overturn Obergefell. They personally don't like it. And I'm very worried because we have all these state legislatures passing resolutions calling on the Supreme Court to overturn Obergefell. We have the Southern Baptist Conference calling for a ban on marriage equality. So, it makes me angry, and it upsets me because I just don't understand why.\nIn this piece, John and Jim, I just wanted to humanize uh something that a lot of people just think of as a court case.\nFor his part, composer Viet Cuong said reflecting through music the love of two people and the legal victory it led to has been a privilege.\nIt's really, really meaningful. And uh, something I never imagined when I was 11 playing the Pachelbel Canon on the piano, that one day I could be out as a gay man writing a piece called John and Jim that's actually celebrating marriage equality and to have it performed in a cathedral in Washington D.C. and to have my husband sitting next to me. It's unreal.\n\nFor the PBS NewsHour, I'm Jeffrey Brown at the Washington National Cathedral.\n\nComing up this evening online at pbs.org, Miles O'Brien has a look at the huge challenges facing one of America's iconic waterways, the Mississippi River, which helps power a $400 billion economy. Miles O'Brien has a preview from Minneapolis of Tipping Point, the Mighty Mississippi. Miles, tell us a little bit about what you're planning.\nWilliam, we're going to spend about 90 minutes taking a deep dive on some of the issues surrounding the Mississippi River. Uh it has some mighty big problems. Agricultural runoff, which leads to a dead zone in the Gulf, riverside communities dealing with flooding, a coastal situation in the mouth of the river uh in the Delta where they're losing wetlands. All of these problems do have solutions, so we're going to explore them in Tipping Point: The Mighty Mississippi River. So, we invite you to tune in.\nSounds so great, Miles. Thank you.

  "summary": "Tonight's news is dominated by escalating violence and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, coupled with significant political developments within the U.S. and Israel. A major focus is the killing of Saifullah Kamal Musallet, a 20-year-old Palestinian American, who was beaten to death by Israeli settlers in the West Bank. This event, marking the fifth death of an American in the region since the Gaza war began, has prompted a strong call for an investigation from the U.S. Ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, highlighting a surge in settler violence to a two-decade high. The broader conflict includes a deadly crowd surge at a humanitarian aid site in Gaza that killed 20 Palestinians, and Israeli airstrikes that killed 54, with Israel claiming it targets only Hamas militants. Concurrently, a separate conflict in Syria sees deadly fighting in Suwayda between Druze militias and Bedouin tribes, leading to Syrian military intervention and retaliatory Israeli strikes on Damascus. Despite a U.S.-announced ceasefire, a key Druze faction vows to continue fighting, and the UN Security Council is set to address the volatile situation. In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government faces instability as the ultra-Orthodox Shas party quits his coalition over a military conscription dispute, leaving him with a minority in parliament. On the U.S. domestic front, President Trump publicly criticized his own supporters and Republicans over the handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case, dismissing it as a 'hoax' after the Justice Department decided against releasing more files. His administration is also facing scrutiny for deporting five immigrants with serious criminal records to Eswatini, a move enabled by a recent Supreme Court decision. In Ukraine, Russia has intensified its aerial attacks ahead of a new September ceasefire deadline set by President Trump, who has also threatened further sanctions against the Kremlin if a peace deal is not reached. Economic news provided a slight reprieve, with Wall Street stocks rising after President Trump denied rumors that he intended to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The broadcast also touched upon cultural and scientific items, including the multi-million dollar auction of a massive Martian meteorite and a juvenile dinosaur skeleton, and noted a dramatic drop in Canadian tourism to the U.S., attributed to harsh presidential rhetoric.",
