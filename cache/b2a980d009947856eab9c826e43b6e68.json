    "full_text": "impact on public broadcasting. This is such an American institution trusted by people across political divides and what's so short-sided about it, I think is that this affects mostly rural communities. We speak to the president of Planned Parenthood to discuss the fallout of funding cuts to that organization. Planned Parenthood is a part of the public health infrastructure. Moving our economy for 160 years. BNSF, the engine that connects us. BNSF, the engine that connects us. Friends of the NewsHour, including Robert S. Kaplan, and Wendy J. Seldon, through the Raymond James Charitable Endowment Fund. Carnegie Corporation of New York, working to reduce political polarization through philanthropic support for education, democracy, and peace. More information at Carnegie.org. And with the ongoing support of these individuals and institutions. This program was made possible by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and by contributions to your PBS station from viewers like you. Thank you. Welcome to the NewsHour. The clock is ticking for Congress to claw back more than $9 billion of federal funding for programs including foreign aid and public media. Tomorrow is the final deadline for the House to pass the so-called recisions package, which is a priority for President Trump. Lisa Desjardins joins me now with the latest. Lisa, bring us up to speed where this recisions bill is. Well, the House is preparing to vote. My reporting is it will happen very late tonight or perhaps in the early morning hours. This is the final vote needed to pass these immediate cuts. And my reporting is that the votes are in fact there. Those who have opposed this in the past told me today that now they are more or less on board. There may still be a few no Republican votes. But this is on track to pass later tonight. Now, it should go without saying, this is a major victory for President Trump and his ability to sway Congress. Many Republicans did not want to vote on this. Thought this was really not worth their time. It's not really a lot of money in the scheme of the whole federal budget. And many of them privately would have voted no if it was a secret ballot vote. But this is on track to pass in the next hours. Given that, we've talked about this quite a bit over the last few weeks. This is going to have some impacts. Let's talk about those impacts on public broadcasting. Right. The public broadcasting portion is 1.1 billion dollars. It's it's the smaller portion, but it is the only portion where cut, uh, funding is completely eliminated. All of the funding for public broadcasting for the next two years is eliminated here. Very significant. Now, NPR has, their CEO has put out a statement saying this is a risk to public safety because of potential cuts to emergency broadcasts, for example. And also PBS's CEO, Paula Kerger, put out a statement today as well. She wrote, these cuts will significantly impact all of our stations, but will be especially devastating to smaller stations and those serving large rural areas. We put together a map using Corporation of Public Broadcasting data of the rural stations most at risk. These are stations around the country where they, they depend on 40% or more of their funding from the federal government. These are the ones most at risk. You see a large number of them in Alaska, but they are all over the country, notably not on the Eastern Seaboard, really not in major cities. These are the rural areas that are in trouble or could have trouble. What will happen with these stations? Well, it is going to be a months long progress. I know a lot of our viewers are watching on those stations right now. And each station will have to sort out how they move forward. What their needs are. Uh, do they depend more on their viewers? Do they work together with other stations? Can they survive this? It is a critical historical moment for stations that have been around for generations. Now, there is one other piece of reporting I want to raise. There was a side deal that I have reporting on made by Don Bacon of Nebraska who voted yes ultimately, there he is for this deal that had to do with PBS funding. Now, here is what he told me earlier this month about the side deal. He wrote, he said, quote, I got a commitment to make sure PBS is funded this year from Speaker Johnson and I trust the speaker. That commitment supposedly is to take place in September, but there were real questions about how that works. He again told me today that he did trust the speaker. We will have to see. Public media separately, there's also as you've reported quite a bit, so much about foreign aid in this bill. You did report earlier this week how PEPFAR, the HIV AIDS program was pulled out of that, but there are still major cuts for foreign aid. Tell us about that. Right, those cuts to PEPFAR, those are off the table now. That program will survive completely intact right now. But let's take a look at those other cuts in uh, foreign aid. Now, four billion of that is economic and democratic programs, uh, really fostering democracy in other countries as well as the economies of of countries where the United States is worried about potential economic or political collapse. $800 million is for shelter, water needs, sanitation, and also family reunification. 500 million for countries facing natural disasters. Again, some of those basic needs. So, while we've been talking about PEPFAR and HIV, these are also day-to-day living needs and this is money that will be cut off as soon as the president signs this bill. There are longer term implications to this, right? Yes, there are significant longer-term implications. I'm very happy to talk about them because what this is doing is it is setting in motion an entirely new way of funding using government's funding power. We expect as soon as this is signed, maybe more recisions offers from the president, more requests. And what this does is all of the funding that is being cut here was passed by Congress with 60 votes in the Senate. But it's being cut by just over 50 votes. So it's changing the dynamic so that the White House has the funding power. The Senate's 60 vote margin really is not as important anymore. So what the president can do here is just continue to cut, cut, cut, no matter what Congress spends. It is yet another shift toward presidential power. These huge titanic developments here. Uh, one other piece of news from Capitol Hill today, the Senate Judiciary Committee advanced a nominee to a very controversial nominee to a very important court. Update us on that. That's right. We've covered it here before. This is Emil Bovey. He right now is the number three official at the Department of Justice. He's in his 40s. He has a long history. He has been a clerk in courts, a prosecutor, also was a defense attorney for President Donald Trump. A lot of controversy over his demeanor, but also over his role specifically in helping fire prosecutors who went after President Trump in the January 6th case, as well as his role in that plea deal with the New York City mayor Eric Adams, the dropping of charges there. Now, the controversy really bubbled up today in the Senate Judiciary Committee where Republicans moved forward his uh, nomination. But Democrats wanted more time to debate. And so they acted in protest today in that committee. There you see, they stood up because they wanted more time to talk about this nominee and they left the room in protest. Now, there was some debate a little bit in committee today and there was a back and forth over who is the problem here. Is it Democrats for opposing this nominee or is it Republicans for pushing him forward? This is us simply trying to rush through one of the most controversial nominees we've had under this presidential administration. Sir, God bless America. You are a good man. You are a decent man. Why are you doing this? What is Donald Trump saying to you that are making you do something which is violating the decorum of this committee? The vicious partisan attacks and obstruction of nominees that we've seen from Democrats, this Congress has to stop. One day, roles will reverse again. And my colleagues will want the same fairness for nominees of their president that they refuse to extend to President Trump's nominees. Quickly, I want to play the sound of Morej, who signed a letter, who expressed why he's concerned about this. Mr. Bovey, um, has, uh, great experience as a lawyer. However, uh, implicit in his resume is that, uh, he engaged in, um, some questionable ethical behavior, uh, as a prosecutor, including being sanctioned, uh, by a judge. He has been, uh, the architect of of a purge in the Department of Justice, where he has systematically fired career prosecutors who were engaged in the January 6th prosecution. Bovey told Senators though that it's a wildly inaccurate representation of him and he's just an attorney. He is on track to get this important nomination and confirmation. Lisa, thank you so much. You're welcome. We begin the day's other headlines with a stunning development in the Briana Taylor case. The Justice Department is recommending a one-day sentence for Brett Hankison, the former Kentucky police officer who was convicted in the 2020 killing of Miss Taylor during a botched home raid. Her death sparked nationwide protests against racial injustice. Last year, a jury convicted Hankison of violating Taylor's civil rights when he fired several shots through her window. DOJ officials say his prosecution was excessive and point out that he did not hit or injure anyone. Hankison will be sentenced next week and faces a maximum sentence of life in prison. The White swelling in his legs. Press Secretary Caroline Levitt confirmed that the 79-year-old is suffering from what's called chronic venous insufficiency, which occurs when leg veins struggle to pump blood back up to the heart. Levitt said it's a common and benign condition for those over 70. The White House also said recent bruising on the president's hand relates to his quote frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin. Overall, Levitt said, the president remains in excellent health. Turning overseas, in Iraq, officials say a fire at a newly opened shopping center killed more than 60 people including children. Funerals were underway for the deceased today, though at least 14 bodies are still unidentified. The blaze broke out late last night in the eastern city of Kut, leaving the mall an empty shell just a week after it opened. Local officials say the cause is still under investigation, but that legal cases have been filed against the building and shopping center owners. They've been offering no details yet on what charges they face. An Israeli shell hit the compound of the only Catholic Church in Gaza today, killing at least three people and injuring 10 others. The Holy Family Catholic Church was sheltering hundreds of Christians and Muslims on its grounds. Among those wounded was the priest who used to speak with the late Pope Francis about the war. A funeral was held today at a separate church where community members mourned two of those killed. Today we stood at the burial of citizen Saad Salama, who was a guard for the church, and Mrs. Fuamia Ayad, an educator who was a school principal and teacher of generations. They were coming out of their prayers when they were killed. Pope Leo released a statement expressing his quote profound hope for dialogue, reconciliation, and enduring peace in the region. Israel issued a rare apology for the shelling and said it's investigating. The UK is planning to lower its voting age from 18 to 16 before the next general election. The governing Labour Party announced the move today, saying it's aimed at boosting participation in the democratic process. Critics say it's an attempt to alter the electorate in their favor. Roughly 1.6 million people in Britain are aged 16 or 17. That's about 3% of the population. The plan is seen as the biggest expansion of UK voting rights since the age fell from 21 to 18 back in 1969. If approved by Parliament, the UK would join Australia, Brazil, and Ecuador in allowing 16-year-olds to vote in national elections. Back in this country, the Food and Drug Administration is allowing Juul to continue selling its e-cigarettes in the US. Officials determined that its benefits as a less harmful alternative for adult smokers outweigh the risks of young people using the product. It's welcome relief for the company, which has been blamed for creating a vaping trend among teens. In 2022, the FDA banned its products from shelves but soon reversed course and agreed to a scientific review. The FDA's decision covers both tobacco and menthol flavored versions of its products. The Steve Miller Band is canceling its US tour due to concerns over extreme weather. In a statement, the 81-year-old classic rocker said that extreme heat, flooding, tornadoes, hurricanes, and fires, quote, make these risks for you, our audience, the band, and the crew unacceptable. Miller's tour was set to begin next month with stops including New York, Florida, and California. This cancellation comes after extreme weather events affected the Bonnaroo Festival in Tennessee in June and last week's Rock the Country event in Kentucky. And on Wall Street today, stocks rose after some better than expected economic reports. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added more than 200 points on the day. The Nasdaq climbed more than 150 points to hit a new record. The S&P 500 also closed at a new all-time high. And the singer Connie Francis has died. You and I are through of lipstick on your collar told a tale on you. She had more than a dozen top 20 hits in the late 1950s and early 60s, with songs like \"Lipstick on Your Collar\" and \"Who's Sorry Now.\" Francis started singing as a child and signed a record contract when she was a teenager, but her later life was troubled. She was raped at knifepoint in 1974 and was committed to a psychiatric hospital by her father in the 1980s. Earlier this year, though, she came back into the public eye when her song \"Pretty Little Baby\" blew up on TikTok. Pretty little baby, I'm so in love with you. She said that a song I recorded 63 years ago is telling a whole new generation of audience is truly overwhelming for me. Thank you, Tom. She was hospitalized two weeks ago for extreme pain. Connie Francis was 87 years old. Still to come on the NewsHour: Public media faces tough choices as Republicans slash federal funding. The IRS looks to share personal data with immigration agents as deportations ramp up. Journalist Jose Antonio Vargas discusses an update to his book about undocumented immigrants. This is the PBS NewsHour from the David M. Rubenstein Studio at WETA in Washington and in the West from the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism at Arizona State University. As we've heard, the House is moving to revoke a billion dollars in already approved funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the entity that steers taxpayer funds to PBS, NPR, and public media stations. To talk about the potential impact on PBS, we turn to one of this network's most acclaimed and most watched filmmakers and directors, Ken Burns. The Ken Burns Collection on PBS includes more than 40 documentaries on a wide range of subjects, including the Civil War, baseball, Vietnam, and country music. His new documentary series, \"The American Revolution\" is scheduled to premiere on PBS in November. Ken Burns, so good to have you on the program. The federal government, as you well know, has for over five decades supported through CPB public media. That very much looks likely to end starting tomorrow. As someone whose work is so central to this network, how is this news sitting with you? Well, not very well. I think we're all in a bit of a state of a shock, uh, and and also sort of reeling at the shortsightedness of it all. This is such an American institution, trusted by people across political divides, geographic divides, age groups, and what's so, um, shortsighted about it, I think is that this affects mostly rural communities or or or the hardest hit. We've my own films probably get somewhere around 20% of any given budget from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. That's a significant hit. We'll scramble. We'll have to make it up. Uh, I'm confident that with the extra work, it will happen. But it's those projects at the national level that get, might get 50 or 60, maybe even 75% of their funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. They just won't be able to be made. And so there'll be less representation by all the different kinds of filmmakers. People coming up will have an impossible time getting started. I think the first film that I made and was broadcast by PBS in the early '80s, called Brooklyn Bridge, had money from CPB and from various CPB programs. And so there is a, there's a kind of poll that we feel. The my, my biggest thing is I travel around the system all the time, and I meet in big markets and small markets, and you begin to see the way in which, particularly in those small rural markets, the PBS station is really like the public library. It's one of those important institution. It may be the only place where people have access to local news, that the local station is going to the, um, the city council meeting, they're going to the school board meeting, they're going to the zoning board. There's a kind of sense of local accountability, and as as news becomes nationalized and even internationalized, there's a, there's a loss there. It's not just, they're not just losing the prime time schedule, they're losing also contact with emergency alert systems and homeland security and continuing education in classroom and the air along with our, with children's programming and and prime time. So there's a sense that this is incredibly short-sighted move uh, to do this. There are so many unknowns about how this will play out. I mean, the leaders of PBS and NPR and the NewsHour have said, we are not going away. We will keep doing our work. But given that given that there are so many institutions getting cuts, public education, um, public health, medical research, do you think that PBS, writ large, public media writ large, will be able to fill this funding gap given there are so many other out-stretched hands? Well, that's a really wonderful question. I think the answer has to be, yes, we're not giving up. One of my films that you mentioned is Baseball, and Yogi Berra said it ain't over till it's over, and I, I, I do not think it's over, and I think we're going to keep trying to make our case. And I think the absence of us will be, uh, particularly pronounced, and I think people, um, across the aisle, this is not a political thing. This is the most American of of institutions. Uh, people across the aisle will be suddenly realizing, oh, I think we've gone a little bit too far and find ways, um, to appropriate, you know, I've been working for the last decade on a film about the American Revolution. And one of the things, of course, at the heart of it is all those great ideas, particularly the second sentence of the Declaration, which ends with a for most Americans a kind of inscrutable phrase, the pursuit of happiness. The key word in that is not happiness, I think, but pursuit. And I think a lot of people have understood happiness to mean uh, the acquisition of things in a marketplace of objects. But what the founders actually meant was lifelong learning in a marketplace of ideas, that in order to be this new thing that had not existed in the world, which is what makes the revolution such an impoted. That education had to be part of it, and it had to be continuing education. Otherwise you couldn't be virtuous. But I think we're all kind of committed to redoubling our efforts and making our case uh, for restoring funding, uh, in in in some way, shape or form. Perhaps in appropriations as we approach the new budget in whatever. It just seems like there's no need, there was no need to have to reinvent the wheel that I think we're now being forced to do. As you well know, Republican administrations going back decades have been trying to cut public media funding, alleging that there is a inherent liberal bias. How do you push back on that allegation? Well, I I push back everywhere. Um, I William F. Buckley, uh, noted conservative thinker, had a program on PBS called Firing Line for 32 years. That program is still going on, is still moderated by a conservative. And so I, I think somehow, we have to separate what becomes the ideological football of the moment, this idea and it's a legitimate argument that the government shouldn't be in any way involved in this. So, though every government on Earth is of course involved in it in some ways, and then the fact that it is so, um, woven into the fabric of our American community, is such a patriotic thing. The brand itself of PBS is the most trusted in the country, that I think, um, we've, we've, we're throwing the baby out with the bathwater here, and I think we've got an obligation to the people who depend on us to make sure that we can come back as, as vibrantly as I know we will. Uh, we will continue to do it. We'll still, we'll still have those programmings. But I'm still worried about that small town in Nebraska or South Dakota or Alaska that is suddenly really in the greatest existential crisis they've ever had, and their citizens will be bereft of the services that the public broadcasting service, not system, offers them. Ken Burns, always great to talk to you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Since President Trump signed his sweeping domestic policy bill into law, one key provision, which prevents Planned Parenthood clinics from receiving Medicaid funding, has already been blocked by a federal judge after the organization sued. Tomorrow, Judge Indera Talwani will hear the first arguments in the case since she issued a temporary restraining order. Joining us now to discuss this further is the President and CEO of Planned Parenthood, Alexis McGill Johnson. Thank you so much for being here. As I mentioned, Judge Talwani has already said that she believes your case is likely to succeed in proving that parts of this law are unconstitutional. What is the argument you're making in this suit? You know, ultimately, this case is about the fact that this reconciliation bill is devastating to patients and the entire healthcare system, all because of a decades-long plan to target and defund Planned Parenthood. We see our our argument and our best case is to expose the naked attempt to attack and really punish Planned Parenthood not simply for providing access to, uh, abortion care, uh, which we know Medicaid does not cover, but in fact, to be a strong advocate and and and vocal rights supporter for abortion access across this country. And so, we are leaning heavily on the First Amendment to protect our right to free speech and our right to association, uh, because we believe that that is a fundamental freedom that should protect, uh, everyday Americans to seek access to healthcare, uh, from the providers who fight so hard on their behalf. If, as you're saying, though, that Medicaid doesn't cover abortion, why was this so crucial for Planned Parenthood? I mean, what would happen if your suit failed and Medicaid was blocked? Well, in fact, you know, Medicaid is uh, an insurance provider, as we know, for low-income communities, and half of all Planned Parenthood patients rely on Medicaid to get care. You know, Planned Parenthood is a part of the public health infrastructure. We are a safety net of safety nets. And so taking away access to Medicaid for patients who need sexual and reproductive healthcare services in largely rural communities or medically underserved areas is devastating on, uh, the communities that are being served. Planned Parenthood providers, just like any other healthcare provider, uh, deserve to be reimbursed for the services that they provide, whether they are, uh, being reimbursed under a program like Medicaid or private insurance. And so, uh, we think it is fundamentally unconstitutional to target an organization like Planned Parenthood simply because we support abortion rights. Conservatives have argued that this isn't about Planned Parenthood per se, but it's about the power of Congress to decide where taxpayer dollars are spent. Some of those legislators also argue that they just simply don't want any money to support abortion care, reproductive care at all. What is your counter to that? The way this law was designed was specifically to target Planned Parenthood as a provider, uh, and our associated, uh, organizations, affiliated organizations. So, you know, when you, when you design a law that intends to just trap one organization, at best two, uh, in it, that is really a targeted backdoor abortion ban because they know that by, uh, attacking the resources that Planned Parenthood gets for providing things like STI testing and treatment, for providing birth control, for providing, you know, wellness exams and breast cancer, uh, screenings. Those are the sorts of things that are being defunded in this, uh, egregious law. Uh, not, and and access to, uh, abortion is, is really just a backdoor ban while they take away access to the other services. There was a recent KFF poll that indicated that 46% of Republicans in the US oppose defunding Planned Parenthood, but nearly all the Republicans in Congress voted for the law that does exactly what you're arguing. How do you explain that mismatch? I think what we have is a Congress that has been heavily gerrymandered, meaning the districts have been designed to, uh, you know, essentially elect some of the most extreme Republicans who are out of step with their constituents. State by state, as you have seen in ballot initiative after ballot initiative. States like, uh, Kentucky and Montana, and, um, you know, Ohio and Michigan, uh, Kansas, states that that are are purple or red at best, uh, have all voted in support of reproductive freedom one way or another. But we also know it is incredibly close. This bill passed, uh, with just the bare minimum margin in both the House and the Senate. All of those Republican senators who voted to defund Planned Parenthood are now vulnerable in many ways because of their, uh, constituents that are going to be harmed in the areas that they are serving. I want to ask you just one broader picture question here. I mean, it's been three years since Roe was overturned. I'm just curious, how you all are approaching this moment, with an administration and some state legislatures that seem determined to, to double down on these attacks on reproductive and abortion care. I will tell you that every single day, uh, Planned Parenthood health centers open up their doors, right? The, the people who are truly on the front line of fighting tyranny, they walk through protesters, they, uh, ensure safe passage for patients into clinics and they deliver the most incredible, high-quality, time-sensitive, life-affirming care imaginable. I won't say it is not a challenge, obviously, to do it in a climate that has been determined to, you know, tear us down at every fight, to deny our ability to make the most basic healthcare decisions about our own bodies, and yet, uh, you know, in true admiration, they show up because they know that, um, when people are denied the opportunity to, uh, make decisions about their lives, you know, um, then they are, are denied the opportunity to deter determine their futures. And we know most Americans are with us on that and that is also what keeps us going. All right, that is Alexis McGill Johnson, President and CEO of Planned Parenthood. Thank you so much for being here. Thank you. Today in Syria, violence continued between rival factions, even after a ceasefire deal happened yesterday. Government troops withdrew overnight from Sweida, as Israel said it would not allow Syrian forces south of Damascus, extending Israel's attempted control of that area. Stephanie Sa updates the situation and then looks at this new nation's fragile stability. And a warning, images in this report may disturb some viewers. Today in Southern Syria, a massacre. Armed Druze militias chase, tortured and killed Bedouin tribe members, including women and children. An act of apparent vengeance, after Bedouin attacks on Sunday escalated into conflict. The brutality comes despite a fragile ceasefire agreement signed yesterday between the Syrian government, the Druze Union, and local tribal leaders in Sweida. But the conflict is not just local. Israeli strikes Wednesday on the Presidential Palace and Defense Ministry headquarters in Damascus raise the stakes. Today, US State Department spokesperson Tamry Bruce said the US did not support those strikes. The United States unequivocally condemns the violence. All parties must step back and engage in meaningful dialogue that leads to a lasting ceasefire. The US has supported the interim Syrian government, led by Ahmed Al-Shara, a former Jihadist who has promised peace. 10 days ago, the US lifted its terrorist designation on Hayat Tereer Al-Sham, his former armed rebel group, now part of the interim government. And in May, Al-Shara met with President Trump, a day after Trump lifted sanctions on Syria. An array of groups holds sway in the country. In the northeast, the Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces, supported by the United States. And in the northwest, swath of territory are controlled by Turkish-backed militias. Other opposition groups hold pockets of power in the south. And Israel occupies and controls the Golan Heights. Since the new interim government came into power in late March, instability has been rife. The nation's many factions and tribes have come head-to-head. In March, 1500 Alawites, a religious minority that once controlled Syria under the 50-year Assad family dictatorship, were slaughtered by forces of the new government. This after former officers loyal to ousted President Bashar Al-Assad attempted a coup in Latakia. Once the Assad dynastic power base. And while interim Syrian President Ahmad Al-Shara denounced the killings and vowed justice, his own government has been criticized for aiding and abetting Syria's instability. Today, Al-Shara promised to protect the Druze. I also address the Druze people. We assure you that protecting your rights and freedom is one of our priorities, and we reject any effort that aims to drag you to an external party or to create division within our ranks. But long-standing divisions continue to threaten Syria. After today's bloodshed, the Bedouins have already vowed another round of revenge. To break down the recent developments in Syria and its regional and geopolitical implications, let's turn to Hassan Hassan, a long-time Syrian analyst and the founder and editor-in-chief of New Lines Magazine, joining us today from Virginia. Hassan, it's great to have you on the NewsHour. I want to jump right in to what triggered the appalling violence we're seeing in Sweida, where clashes erupted between these Druze militias and Sunni Bedouin tribes. What started this? So, this was a long simmering problem in Syria, uh, over the past few months, but it uh, what happened this time is that Israel poured gas into it, uh, basically. Uh, over the past few months, uh, especially over like the past seven months since the Assad regime, uh, fell. This is a regime that ruled Syria for, uh, almost 60 years. Um, um, the, uh, the new government controlled most of Syria except for four uh, provinces. One of these is uh, uh, closer, uh, closer to Israel, and it's dominated by the Druze. And those refused to be part of the government. There is one uh, Druze leader, uh, backed by Israel, who refused basically to to be part of uh, the new government, considering it kind of an extremist orga- uh, uh, government. And, um, he refused to be part of that, and that was the source of uh, tensions that kind of triggered many uh, incidents of violence over the past seven months. Right. So Israel, though, says they are there, they bombed Damascus yesterday to protect this Druze minority. Do they have other reasons for why they would target Damascus and want to see this government that is still trying to consolidate and unify Syria, uh, which isn't easy. Um, do they have other reasons to want that destabilization? Uh, Israel does, yes. Uh, so Israel has its own reasons. Uh, it has been concerned about this new regime in Syria. It regards it as a jihadist, um, a jihadist-dominated, uh, regime because the current president is a former, uh, jihadist. So, Israel thinks that it it has security concerns, uh, that it cannot trust this new regime. They think that this regime, backed by Turkey in Syria, is basically a future, uh, threat that Israel cannot just allow to stabilize the country and and and control the whole country in the, for, you know, for the for the long run. On the other hand, Hassan, the transitional government itself, led by President Al-Shara, um, has been accused of its treatment of the Druze minority, um, and we, we just talked about in the piece, um, about a massacre against the Alawites a few months ago. So, in both cases, in March, uh, when incidents happened or clashes between the Syrian government or pro-government forces in the coastal region, the western region of Syria, and now, uh, in the southern part of Syria against the Druze or between the Druze and the government, uh, both incidents were triggered objectively speaking by, uh, the Alawites and the Druze. But the violence that uh, perpetrated, you know, perpetrated against the Alawites and the Druze, uh, have caused have raised concerns about how, um, the new government, uh, treats, uh, minorities. Uh, this is a a real concern, uh, for both Syrians and for outsiders. Uh, especially that many of these atrocities, at least according to the government, are committed by pro-government forces that are, you know, tend to be radical or extremist, and they don't follow the orders. The orders from Damascus. And yet there are a lot of international players, including the United States government, continuing to support the interim government and Al-Shara. Is the violence that we've seen in the last few days, Hassan, existential to his ability to hold the country together, Personally, I don't think, uh, these, the the problems in Sweida, with the Druze, or, uh, even in the coastal region with the Alawite, are existential problems for the new order in Syria. The majority of Syrians, they, uh, believe that the return of the Assad regime or a new order that's doesn't that's not Sunni dominated will not be accepted. So, I don't think it's an existential threat in that sense, except if Iran, if Israel, and, uh, or the Israeli policy becomes a, you know, US, uh, policy. For example, that's when, uh, Damascus starts to be worried. Over the past seven months, they, uh, you know, uh, authorities in Damascus have tried to engage in peace, peace talks, despite, uh, push sometimes, uh, for example, from Turkey to attack the Kurdish, uh, you know, dominated area and retake the, retake it by force, uh, Damascus has tried to say, no, let's talk with them and and kind of try to peacefully integrate these, uh, forces into, into the government. Even what's happening now, it's a mix of old problems, uh, with new complications, and then you have regional interests. What what happened, uh, in favor of of Damascus, the new regime in Syria, is that almost all countries have supported, uh, their stability, and they they US, Europe, um, Russia, even Iran and others, were all, have said the right things in terms of our interest in, is in stabilizing Syria and supporting this government. But this government has to act and behave like a government that represents all Syrians. That is Hassan Hassan of New Lines Magazine. Hassan, thank you for your insights. Thank you for having me.

  "summary": "Congress is facing a critical deadline to pass a 'recisions package' championed by President Trump, which aims to claw back over $9 billion in federal funding. A significant portion of these cuts, $1.1 billion, is directed at completely eliminating federal funding for public broadcasting for the next two years. Leaders from NPR and PBS, including CEO Paula Kerger, have voiced strong concerns, warning of risks to public safety due to potential cuts to emergency broadcasts and devastating impacts on smaller, rural stations that heavily rely on federal support, particularly in regions like Alaska.\n\nThe proposed cuts signify a notable shift in governmental funding dynamics, enabling the White House to effectively cut congressionally approved funding with a simple majority vote, thereby increasing presidential power. Separately, the Senate Judiciary Committee controversially advanced the nomination of Emil Bovey to an important court position. Bovey, a former defense attorney for President Donald Trump and a Department of Justice official, faces scrutiny over his alleged role in firing prosecutors involved in the January 6th case and a plea deal related to New York City Mayor Eric Adams. Democrats staged a protest, accusing Republicans of rushing the nomination.\n\nIn other news, the Justice Department recommended a minimal sentence for Brett Hankison, a former Kentucky police officer convicted in the 2020 killing of Briana Taylor, despite her death sparking nationwide protests against racial injustice. International incidents include a devastating shopping center fire in Iraq that killed over 60 people, and an Israeli shell hitting the Holy Family Catholic Church in Gaza, resulting in three deaths and multiple injuries. Additionally, the UK's Labour Party announced plans to lower the voting age to 16, a move aimed at boosting democratic participation but criticized as an attempt to alter the electorate.",
