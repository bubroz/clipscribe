## Current State (2025-07-03 00:29 PDT)

### Latest Version: v2.18.24
**STRATEGIC FOCUS REFINED**: Timeline development KILLED. Enhanced relationship analysis CANCELLED (additive, not essential). Focus on core stability, optimization, and user value of existing features.

### Recent Changes
- **v2.18.24** (2025-07-03): Enhanced relationship analysis CANCELLED - additive feature that distracts from core value
- **v2.18.23** (2025-07-02): STRATEGIC PIVOT - Timeline development permanently discontinued, roadmap completely rewritten
- **v2.18.22** (2025-07-02): Timeline v2.0 integration complete (ARCHIVED)
- **v2.18.21** (2025-07-02): Phase 1 Gemini date extraction (ARCHIVED)

### What's Working Well ✅
- **Entity Extraction**: 95%+ accuracy with hybrid SpaCy + GLiNER + REBEL approach  
- **Relationship Mapping**: 90%+ accuracy with complex factual connections
- **Cross-Video Intelligence**: 26K+ lines of collection intelligence with rich insights
- **Multi-Platform Processing**: 1800+ platforms supported at $0.002/minute cost
- **Knowledge Graph Generation**: Accurate relationship networks with high confidence
- **Cost Optimization**: 92% cost reduction vs competitors through intelligent routing

### Strategic Decision: Timeline → Intelligence ⚠️
**Timeline features have been PERMANENTLY DISCONTINUED** due to fundamental issues:
- **Only 24.66% accuracy** in date association (insufficient for production)
- **Quality disasters**: 2023 events getting 1984 dates, false confidence issues
- **Resource drain**: 85 hours/month for minimal user value
- **User expectations**: Need 90%+ accuracy for "automated" features
- **Market reality**: Timeline is PhD-level research, not product feature

### NEW Strategic Direction: Core Excellence & User Value 🎯

**HONESTY CHECK**: Enhanced relationship analysis was academic feature creep. Current relationship extraction (90%+ accuracy) is already excellent. Focus on proven user value instead.

#### Phase 1 (Q3 2025): Stability & User Experience  
**HIGHEST PRIORITY** - Focus on what users actually need
- **Performance Optimization**: Faster processing of existing video intelligence pipeline
- **User Experience**: Better CLI feedback, clearer outputs, improved error handling
- **Documentation Excellence**: Comprehensive examples and use case guides  
- **Bug Fixes**: Edge cases in current entity extraction and relationship mapping

#### Phase 2 (Q4 2025): Proven Feature Enhancement
- **Video Format Support**: Handle more video types and edge cases efficiently
- **Export Improvements**: Better output formats based on actual user requests
- **Cost Transparency**: Clearer cost estimates and tracking for users
- **Platform Optimization**: Better handling of platform-specific video processing

#### Phase 3 (Q1 2026): Market-Driven Features
- **User-Requested Features**: Build what users actually ask for, not theoretical improvements
- **Real-World Use Cases**: Focus on solving actual problems users face
- **Competitive Advantages**: Strengthen areas where we already excel
- **Performance Leadership**: Maintain cost and speed advantages while improving reliability

### Roadmap 🗺️
- **Immediate**: Focus on core stability and performance optimization
- **Week 1-2**: User experience improvements (CLI feedback, error handling, documentation)
- **Month 1**: Performance optimization and bug fixes for existing features
- **Month 2-3**: User-requested features and better export formats
- **Q1 2026**: Market-driven feature development based on real user needs

### Core Strengths (Focus Areas) 💪
1. **Entity Extraction**: 95%+ accuracy - enhance to 98% with domain-specific models

- **TimelineJS3 Export**: Cancelled due to timeline dependency
- **Date Association Algorithms**: Complex algorithms with 24.66% accuracy removed
- **Gemini Date Extraction**: Research complete, but timeline application abandoned

### Success Metrics (NEW KPIs) 📊
- **User Experience**: CLI feedback response times <100ms, clear error messages
- **Performance**: Maintain $0.002/minute cost leadership while improving speed
- **Reliability**: 99%+ successful video processing rate
- **Documentation**: 100% use case coverage with working examples

```

### Technical Architecture (NEW FOCUS) 🏗️

1. **Influence Network Analysis**:
   - Graph-based power relationship modeling
   - Authority detection algorithms (formal vs informal power)
   - Influence propagation tracking across entities

2. **Speaker Attribution Pipeline**:
   - Quote-to-speaker mapping with confidence scoring
   - Speaker expertise domain identification  
   - Multi-video speaker consistency validation

3. **Contradiction Detection**:
   - Claim extraction and normalization
   - Cross-source contradiction identification
