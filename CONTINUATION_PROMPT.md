## Current State (2025-07-02 23:53 PDT)

### Latest Version: v2.18.23
**STRATEGIC PIVOT EXECUTED**: Timeline development KILLED. All resources redirected to advanced video intelligence extraction. Timeline accuracy was only 24.66% - insufficient for production use.

### Recent Changes
- **v2.18.23** (2025-07-02): STRATEGIC PIVOT - Timeline development permanently discontinued, roadmap completely rewritten
- **v2.18.22** (2025-07-02): Timeline v2.0 integration complete (ARCHIVED)
- **v2.18.21** (2025-07-02): Phase 1 Gemini date extraction (ARCHIVED)
- **v2.18.20** (2025-07-02): Date extraction research and implementation (ARCHIVED)

### What's Working Well ✅
- **Entity Extraction**: 95%+ accuracy with hybrid SpaCy + GLiNER + REBEL approach  
- **Relationship Mapping**: 90%+ accuracy with complex factual connections
- **Cross-Video Intelligence**: 26K+ lines of collection intelligence with rich insights

### Strategic Decision: Timeline → Intelligence ⚠️
**Timeline features have been PERMANENTLY DISCONTINUED** due to fundamental issues:
- **Only 24.66% accuracy** in date association (insufficient for production)
- **Quality disasters**: 2023 events getting 1984 dates, false confidence issues
- **Resource drain**: 85 hours/month for minimal user value
- **User expectations**: Need 90%+ accuracy for "automated" features
- **Market reality**: Timeline is PhD-level research, not product feature

### NEW Strategic Direction: Advanced Intelligence Extraction 🎯

#### Phase 1 (Q3 2025): Advanced Relationship Analysis
**HIGHEST PRIORITY** - 85 hours/month redirected here
- **Influence Network Mapping**: Power dynamics, authority detection, hierarchical relationships
- **Speaker Attribution**: Quote tracking with credibility scoring and expertise domains
- **Contradiction Detection**: Conflicting claims across sources with confidence assessment  
- **Evidence Chain Building**: Legal/research-grade evidence tracking and validation

#### Phase 2 (Q4 2025): Multi-Video Intelligence  
- **Character Arc Tracking**: Entity evolution across video collections
- **Narrative Thread Following**: Story development across multiple sources
- **Information Propagation**: Claim spread tracking and misinformation detection
- **Cross-Reference Validation**: Multi-source fact checking with reliability scoring

#### Phase 3 (Q1 2026): Research Intelligence Tools
- **Citation Generation**: Academic-grade source attribution (APA/MLA/Chicago)
- **Advanced Fact Verification**: Claims vs evidence with external validation
- **Source Discovery**: "Who else talks about X?" intelligent suggestions
- **Research Export**: Academic paper formats, legal brief structures

### Roadmap 🗺️
- **Immediate**: Design influence network mapping architecture
- **Week 1-2**: Implement speaker attribution system and contradiction detection
- **Month 1**: Core advanced relationship features operational
- **Month 2-3**: Multi-video intelligence capabilities
- **Q1 2026**: Research-grade tools for academics and journalists

### Core Strengths (Focus Areas) 💪
