### Known Issues ⚠️
- Minor: Multi-video combined outputs not intuitively located (collection_intelligence.json, unified_knowledge_graph.gexf)
- CLI: Input files in root directory not ideal; needs better handling
- Output naming: Timestamp-based directories may be confusing for users
- No TimelineJS export yet (next on roadmap)

### Roadmap 🗺️
- **Immediate**: Clear cache/old outputs and start fresh for demo recording
- **Discussion**: Optimize file/directory naming for better intuitiveness, especially multi-video combined files
- **Discussion**: Improve CLI input handling (avoid root directory usage)
- **Discussion**: Honest CLI assessment - is it optimal?
- **Action Plan**: Prepare for screen-recorded demo in next hour, generate shareable outputs for friends/colleagues
- **Next**: Implement TimelineJS export for chronological visualization
- **Soon**: Add multi-platform batch processing with progress dashboard
- **Later**: Integrate advanced LLM for deeper collection insights
