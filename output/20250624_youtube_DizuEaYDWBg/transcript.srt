A decision by the Supreme Court today is backing the Trump administration's deportation of migrants to places other than their countries of origin. An earlier ruling had halted these deportation flights until detainees were given notice of their destination and a chance to contest the move. This means the administration will be able to try to quickly remove them to such third countries as South Sudan. Those affected can still attempt to file individual claims. The conservative majority Supreme Court ruled six to three, but did not write a majority opinion. All three liberal judges

2
00:00:32,799 --> 00:01:05,799
dissented. Now joining me live for analysis is Loyola Law Professor Laurie Levenson. Thanks for your time this evening. Good evening. Now we did hear from the dissenting justices, but the conservative majority didn't write an opinion. Is that unusual and what message does this send if any? Well it happens when you have an order like this because basically what they said is that the lower court who put on hold what the Department of Homeland Security was doing shouldn't have done that. Should have allowed the department to continue to remove people to

3
00:01:05,609 --> 00:01:38,609
third countries even while the lawsuits is going on. But the dissent wasn't going to let this go unnoticed because this could have a grave impact. We've already seen people, as you mentioned, being sent to South Sudan. You've seen people who are in true danger if they went to certain countries and the record and judges found that and nonetheless they were sent there. And so basically the administration is trying to get rid of people as quickly as possible and it looks like they're also trying to do it in a way that

4
00:01:38,409 --> 00:02:11,409
puts people in harm's way. They were sending people to Libya where Libya was in a violent turmoil at the time they wanted to do it. Mm. So the ruling does allow the Trump administration to deport some of these people to third countries. Uh, you've talked a little bit about what this says about due process, but can we also kind of walk through like are these people who are convicted criminals or could they be other migrants who kind of get caught up in this and are quickly removed without due process? Well

5
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:44,210
that's the concern. I think that's why the judge wants to have an opportunity for people to be heard. It's even if there's somebody who's ordered to be removed, under the conventions against torture and inhumanity, even non-citizens have the right to have an opportunity explained to them in their language, opportunity to tell the court why you can send me out of the country, but you're not sending me to the place I came from or to another safe place. And so it looks like that the administration almost wants to send a message

6
00:02:44,009 --> 00:03:17,009
by sending people as quickly as possible to places where they don't belong. Now what's going to happen here is the lower court judges will continue to have this trial, but in the meantime, the administration's going to move forward against people and certainly some of them do have convictions. But what we're worried about are mistakes and we know that mistakes have been made. Yeah. Yeah, we've certainly already seen those mistakes happen. So does this set a dangerous precedent? I think that it is a precedent and it it could certainly be dangerous.

00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:49,819
Basically the Supreme Court is deferring so much to the administration when it comes to these types of issues saying that we're not going to get involved in immigration or diplomacy. That belongs to the Department of Homeland Security and the president. But the dissent was saying these are people's lives on the line and there are real challenges under the law, under due process, under statutory law and under conventions. And those should be resolved before you send these people into harm's way. All right. Professor Laurie Levenson, thank you again for joining us
