  "title": "Code a Discord Chat Bot That Talks Like Your Favorite Character - Tutorial",
  "content": "Wanna make a Discord bot that talks like characters from Rick and Morty or Harry Potter? Maybe you wanna make it talk like another favorite character. In this course, Lynn will show you how to create a Discord bot that uses artificial intelligence to talk like a character of your choice.\n\nHi there. I'm Lynn. I'm a software engineer, hobbyist game developer, and recent graduate from the University of Chicago.\n\nIn this tutorial, we're going to build a Discord AI chatbot that can speak like your favorite character.\n\nBefore we start, if you have seen that video by any chance, know that this video is something different and more comprehensive. So keep watching till the end. The original tutorial and my first Discord bot started as a joke between me and my friends when we were playing video games, and it really surprised me how popular it became, and a lot of people wanted to build their own bot based on that tutorial. Therefore, I decided to update that tutorial to include more characters, as well as to show you how to find data for your favorite character.\n\nOther topics that we will cover here include, but are not limited to: how to train the model, how to deploy the model, common errors you might see during this model training and deployment pipeline, and how to solve them. Moreover, we will cover how to build the bot in Python, and how to build it in JavaScript.\n\nLastly, we will cover how to properly deploy the bot to a Discord server and limit it to certain channels, and how to keep the bot running indefinitely. I hope you're excited and let's jump into the tutorial.\n\nFirst, we are going to find data for our character. My favorite sources are Kaggle, Transcript Wiki, and just random fandom websites that came out from the Google search. And my research process goes like this: I first search on Kaggle to see if there are pre-made dialogue datasets.\n\nFor example, if we search for Rick and Morty,\n\nwe get this nicely formatted dataset that includes the name of the character and the line they're speaking.\n\nIf we search for Harry Potter,\n\nhere is another dataset that includes the character and the sentence they're speaking. Since we're building a chatbot, we need only these two columns in our dataset: the character name and the line they're speaking. So these dialogue datasets on Kaggle are perfect for our requirement.\n\nAll right. If we succeeded in finding our data on Kaggle, we can move on to the model training step. But what if we cannot find a dataset for our character on Kaggle? For example, if I want to find a dataset for Peppa Pig,\n\nit looks like there is no dataset for the character. In this case, we may need to find the raw transcript of the media, be it a video game, a cartoon, or a show, and I've found that Transcript Wiki has some great resources.\n\nSo here we have a list of movies, shows, video games, musicals, commercials.\n\nFor example, I was able to find a transcript for Peppa Pig, and also movies like Batman on Transcript Wiki. The transcript looks like this. So we have the character name and their actions or the lines they're speaking. We will see shortly how to turn a raw transcript like this into a dataset like those we saw on Kaggle.\n\nBesides Transcript Wiki, you may also just Google the name of your media with the keyword transcript. For example, my first bot was based on the game, \"The Word Ends With You,\" and it has no results either on Kaggle or Transcript Wiki. So what I did was to just Google the name of the game and \"game transcript.\"\n\nAnd it just happened that this fandom website has the full game transcript. So be sure to utilize your Google search skills to find data for your character.\n\nIf, rather than fictional character, you are more interested in real-life character, you may search for interview scripts as your data source. If you want to create a chatbot that speaks like yourself or your friends, you can treat text messages between you and your friends as dialogues and handcraft your dataset. There are tons of ways to get data for your characters, so be creative. And now we will look at how to turn raw transcript into a dataset.\n\nNow, suppose we have found our raw transcript. Let's see how we can turn it into a two-column character line dataset. Suppose we take this Peppa Pig transcripts and copy them into a text file.\n\nNow we go to Google Colab and upload our data file.\n\nThen we create a Google Colab notebook, and use this to parse our script. So I'm going to name this parse_script.ipynb. And we are going to from Google Colab import drive, and then call drive.mount content drive. This will allow us to read the data from our Google Drive.\n\nAll right. Now that our drive has been mounted, let's import OS and then OS change directory into content drive, my drive. And now we see if there is anything in it. Yeah, we have our peppapig.txt. So here we are going to import regular expression to parse our transcript, put the parsed result into a Pandas data frame, and export it as a CSV file, just like those we saw on Kaggle.\n\nThis is going to be our regular expression pattern.\n\nYou don't have to be a pro in regular expression to understand this part. If we take the pattern to this site, and our test string is Peppa Pig,\n\nyou will see that we have two match capture groups, the first being the character's name, the second being the line spoken, and also for the second line, Mama Pig, we have the character name and the line being spoken.\n\nRight. So that's our regular expression. Now, let's define a dictionary that will store our data. So we know that we need the column name and the column line in our result data frame.\n\nAnd now we open and read the file.\n\nFor each line, we match it with our regular expression pattern.\n\nIf there is a match, we extract name and line from this regular expression match, and then append it to our dictionary here.\n\nAnd then we convert this dictionary into a data frame.\n\nNow we can inspect the data frame. Cool. So we have the name is Peppa Pig, saying that \"I'm Peppa Pig,\" and then George makes a sound, and Mama Pig makes a sound. Great. We can also count the number of lines that belong to our character. So we do sum df name is equal to Peppa Pig. And we saw that Peppa Pig has 38 lines in our entire data frame. So the length of our data frame is over 100 and Peppa Pig has one third of the lines. Great. The last step will be to export the data frame. So df.to_csv, the name will be peppapig.csv, and and we will drop the index. Cool. Now we should have a peppapig.csv in our drive.\n\nAnd here it is: name and line. This is how we parse those raw transcripts into a file that could be used in our model training. So next, let's proceed onto the exciting step: model training.\n\nNow we are going to train the model. Go to my GitHub repository linked to in the description below and download the content. We're going to use this model_train_upload_workflow.ipynb, which looks like this.\n\nAll right. Now our file has been downloaded. We unzip the content.\n\nAnd in here we have a model_train_upload_workflow.ipynb.\n\nWe upload this notebook file to Google Drive and open it in Google Colab.\n\nWe're going to train a GPT model, which is short for Generative Pre-trained Transformer. In the runtime, change runtime type. Make sure to select GPU because this will accelerate our model training. So now here we mount the drive.\n\nWe install the Transformers module that we will be using, and we change directory into my drive.\n\nHere are all the modules that we are importing.\n\nIf we're using the dataset from Kaggle, we need to obtain our API key from Kaggle. So go to our Kaggle profile, go to Account, scroll down to the API key section, create a new API token and download this file as kaggle.json.\n\nWe will go back to Google Drive and upload kaggle.json.\n\nNow we can download our dataset from Kaggle. We're going to use the Harry Potter dataset as an example. So grab this username and the dataset name, and our file is harry_potter_1.csv.\n\nNote that because there are white spaces in our file name, we got special characters in the file name. So let's inspect the content of our data file. Well, CSV files are usually separated by commas, has the name CSV. However, this one looks like it's separated by semicolons. So we need to take care of the semicolons when we are reading in the data into a Pandas data frame. So separation is semicolon instead of a comma. Cool. So let's sample our data to see what's inside. All right. So we have character and sentence. Notice that these two column names aren't exactly what we need. We want the two columns of our data frame to be named as name and line, as used down here in this cell. So we need to change the name of our columns.\n\nAll right. Let's resample our data. Looks like we have successfully changed the name of our columns.\n\nNow let's see how big our data is. So it only has a thousand or so lines, and let's see how many lines our character has.\n\nOur character has 155 lines. So here we change our character name to Harry, and we now run this cell to create a context data frame that includes the current line our character is speaking and several lines directly preceding the line.\n\nA context data frame is useful here because we are creating a conversational chatbot and we want to generate a response based on the conversation context. So let's sample our context data frame. So in the context of clearly something something, our character responds with \"Seems a pity not to ask her.\"\n\nGreat. Now we have our dataset. We split the dataset into a training set and a test set. This is because we don't want to overfit the model. In the case of overfitting, the model will just memorize lines from the dataset and talk back to us using the exact lines. We don't want that. We want the conversation to be more organic. So we're only training the model on the training set and evaluating the model on the test set.\n\nSo we continue running these cells to build datasets, caching checkpoints, and down here we build the model. We will build our model by fine-tuning Microsoft's pre-trained GPT small. Small here refers to the number of parameters in the model. There are also a medium and a large model. Generally, the larger the model, the longer it takes to train, but the smarter the model can get. I would recommend training a medium model as it's pretty smart and not too hard to train. My production chatbot that is currently running on a server with a thousand plus users is also a medium model. For this tutorial, for the sake of time, I'm training just a small model.\n\nYou can see here it's downloading the model and this may take some time because it's essentially 300 megabytes.\n\nHere are some hyperparameters that you may find useful. For example, num_train_epochs is the number of training epochs. This is defined to be four here, and this is the number of times that the model will cycle through the training set. As long as the model is not overfitting, increasing the number of training epochs usually results in smarter models because the model has more time to cycle through the dataset and pick up the nitty-gritty details. There is another hyperparameter called batch size. This is the number of training examples that the model will see in a batch before it updates its gradient. I wouldn't recommend changing this unless you know what you're doing since other hyperparameters like learning rate and temperature might be sensitive to this change in batch size. However, if you're training a larger model on a larger dataset and are running into memory errors, to make the error go away, it might help to decrease the batch size.\n\nThe remaining cells have been configured to take in this context data frame we created, train the model, and save it to a folder called output_small. Now let's run this main function.\n\nTraining will take some time. I trained my medium model for 12 epochs and it took around two hours, so do sit back and grab a snack while the model is training.\n\nYou can see the progress in the progress bars above.\n\nAll right. Here we get back a perplexity answer. This usually refers to how confused the model is. If a model has a large perplexity, it means that the model is pretty confused as to which words to choose to respond to a given situation, and the model might not be very smart. In our case, our dataset is pretty small and only has 150 plus lines, so it makes sense that the perplexity is high. To decrease the perplexity, we might need to train for more epochs. Cool. But now that the training is complete, we can load and chat with the model here.\n\nAll right. Let's change the name of the bot.\n\nHello, fellow Red Rider. So let's ask how's it created?\n\nThere is no such thing as a bad Red Rider.\n\nGreat. It looks like our chatbot is capable of making and maintaining a conversation. Now we can push the model to Hugging Face and start building our Discord chatbot.\n\nAll right. Now let's change directory just into the content folder because we'll be doing our push there, and we do pip install huggingface command-line client, and then we log in using our credentials.\n\nAll right. After logging in, we're assigned this token. We need to grab this token for the cell that we need to do afterwards. So we can create a repository to store our model from the command line. Mine is going to be called dialogue_gpt_small_harry_potter.\n\nAnd our empty model repository is right here. There is nothing except for the git attributes file, but we will be adding the model files soon.\n\nNow we install Git LFS, which stands for Git Large File Storage. This will allows us to push and pull our models. And we replace this token with the token we just copied from above.\n\nSo here's my username and my token.\n\nAnd we call that our training result is stored in this output_small directory.\n\nAnd now we change directory into our dialogue_gpt_small directory because we need to do get, add, and commit from there. We install the Git LFS, and inspect the content of our current directory, which should be dialogue_gpt_small_harry_potter, and also just print out the working directory we're in to make sure that we are inside content. Cool. Now we check the file status on Git. So these files that we need to add to Git. So we do a Git add. This will take some time because the pytorch_model.bin is pretty large. And we configure the global username and user email. These are just my Hugging Face credentials. And we commit with message \"Initial commit.\" And finally, we push the model. It's about 400 megabytes because the PyTorch model is itself about 400 megabytes.\n\nAll right. Looks like the push is complete.\n\nNow we see our PyTorch model here. However, there's one more thing that we need to do before we can converse with the model on Hugging Face. That is, you see here it's tagged as text generation. However, we know that we are training a chatbot model and we want our model to be conversational. For that purpose, we need to add a model card.\n\nSo we create a model card here, and we're putting in our desired model tags. So our tags is conversational.\n\nAnd we commit our model card. And now our model is correctly tagged as conversational. If we go to the main model page, we can start chatting with the model here.\n\nAll right. Now that we have pushed our model to Hugging Face, we're ready to use it in our Discord chatbot.\n\nNow we have our model. Let's build the Discord bot. Here, on Discord, I have my server, Lynn's Dev Lab. I have two channels: one for the Python bot and one for the JavaScript bot. The reason why we have separate channel for the bots is because we don't want the bots to be talking to each other. So after we build the bot, we will learn how to set their permissions correctly so that they don't go outside of their dedicated channel.\n\nSo we go to Discord's developers page, create an application. We need one application per bot. So our name will be ChattyBot Python.\n\nSo here we create a bot, and I'm going to name this Harry Potter Bot Python and upload an icon.\n\nWe will be using this API token here when we create our bot in Python. We're going to host our bot on Repl.it. So sign up for Repl.it and create a new Python Repl here. Going to name this ChattyBot Python.\n\nAnd in here, we will need to store our API tokens for Hugging Face and Discord as environmental variables. So here is a tab for the secrets for the environment variables. So the first one will be huggingface_token.\n\nAnd for the value, we will go to our Hugging Face profile, edit profile, API tokens, copy the API token, come back here, and fill in that value. Next, we'll create a Discord token. And for this value, we go to this Discord developers portal and copy the token. We add the token here, and our environment variables are all set.\n\nNext, I have the Python file in my GitHub repository called discord_bot.py.\n\nSo we grab the code from here, and I will explain the code line by line. Starting from line one, we first import the OS module that will help us reading our environment variables.\n\nNext, we import modules that are useful for querying the Hugging Face model. Finally, we import the Discord module. And here I have my API URL pointing to my username.\n\nAnd we define a bot as follows. In the on_ready function, it takes in a model name, which for me will be dialogue_gpt_small_harry_potter.\n\nThen we store this API endpoint by concatenating this API URL, which is my profile link, with the model name. Then we retrieve the secret API token from the system environment by looking up os.environ huggingface_token.\n\nNext, we format the header in our request to Hugging Face. For the authorization part, we put in bearer and the Hugging Face token. Next, we define a query method that takes in the payload. We dump the payload as a JSON string, and use the request module to make an HTTP POST request to the API endpoint using our defined request headers, which contains our Hugging Face API key and passing in the data.\n\nOnce the request finishes, it should give us a response object, and we decode it from UTF-8 and load the result as a string and return the string. Next, we define an asynchronous function named on_ready. The next two function definitions are based on the Discord API. Both are asynchronous function. The first one is on_ready. This function will be called when the bot is logging in. So when the bot is logging in, we will print out \"Logged in as,\" print out the bot's name and the bot's ID so that we know that the bot is functioning.\n\nNext, because our bot is a chatbot, it needs to respond to messages. So on_message is a method that will be called each time the bot sees a message in the channel. So given the message, if the message is coming from the bot itself, the bot ignores the message and does not reply to it. Otherwise, it will form a query payload with the content of the message.\n\nAnd to make the bot more user-friendly, while the bot is waiting for the HTTP response from the model, we set its status as typing so that the user will know that the bot is generating its response. So this is an asynchronous call with message.channel.typing. We call self.query using the payload and get back the response.\n\nIf there is a valid generated response, there will be a generated_text field in this response, and we'll be able to get that out as the bot's response. Otherwise, there might be an error in the response. We just log out the error message so that we can debug the bot later on.\n\nFinally, we use another asynchronous method to send the bot's response to the channel using message.channel.send. And that's it about our bot definition. In the main function, we just create a bot and pass in the model name. So for me, this is dialogue_gpt_small_harry_potter.\n\nAnd use client.run, looking up the Discord token from the environment variables. Great. Now that our bot should be all set up, let's invite the bot to our channel.\n\nIn the OAuth2 tab, we are going to select the bot.\n\nAnd for the bot permissions, the only thing it needs is to send messages.\n\nSo we copy this URL, paste it in a new browser window, and invite it to my server.\n\nAll right. Now that we see that our bot has appeared. However, it shows as offline. So we need to run the Repl. So we hit run here, and Repl.it is installing all our dependencies and imports.\n\nGreat. Now that our bot has logged in as Harry Potter Bot Python, and this is its unique ID, let's go to the server and now that the bot is online.\n\nI don't want the bot to appear in the general channel, so we go to the channel setting, permissions, advanced permissions, add the bot, and we remove its permission to send messages and save the changes.\n\nNow, let's see what happens if I type something in the general channel. Nothing should happen because the bot shouldn't be able to send a message. Nothing happens, although the bot is online. And now this bot should work in this Python bot channel. So let's do hello.\n\nAnd we briefly saw that there's a typing prompt.\n\nCool. So yeah, this is how we built a bot in Python. One thing to know in our Repl.it is that because we took away the bot's permission to send the messages in the general channel, it is showing an exception, and this is totally okay. If you don't like seeing this exception, you can use a try except block and log out this exception.\n\nGreat. So now we're going to repeat the process for the JavaScript bot. So we go back to the Discord developer portal and create a new application. This time, I'm going to call it ChattyBot JavaScript.\n\nAnd we create a bot.\n\nBack to Repl.it, we create a node.js app. Going to call it chatty_bot.js.\n\nWe again create two environmental variables. The first one is huggingface_token.\n\nCopying my API token from my profile, edit profile, putting here, and copy my Discord bot token. Call this one discord_token, and adding the value. Great. Now we have our environment variable set up.\n\nGo to my GitHub repository. There is a discord_bot.js file that contains the code that we will use for this JavaScript chatbot. Let's copy paste, and I will go through the code line by line. So first we import the Discord API for the JavaScript module, and we import fetch for making HTTP requests, just like we did in Python, and we initialize a new Discord client and define the model URL just as my username and the model name. So this guy is dialogue_gpt_small_harry_potter.\n\nAnd this is the same callback that is called when the bot is ready, just like the on_ready function we saw in Python. So when the bot is ready and logged in, we print out \"Logged in as\" client.user.tag.\n\nAnd here is another callback, this time on_message. We use an asynchronous callback because we are making HTTP requests. Like in the Python script, we ignore the message if the message is from the bot itself by checking if message.author is the bot.\n\nNow we form the payload. So the payload is a dictionary containing inputs with text message.content, which is the message that the bot has received. And we form the request headers by again using the Hugging Face API key. So we read the Hugging Face token from the environment, process.env.huggingface_token, and form the headers.\n\nRight before we start making the HTTP request, we set the bot status to typing. Now we query the server. So the response is the result from this call to fetch using HTTP POST, given the payload as the body and the headers using the Hugging Face token. And we convert the response into JSON format and extract out the generated_text field.\n\nIf there isn't a generated_text field in the response, but instead the response contains an error field, this means that the bot has encountered some errors, and we may want to print out the error for further debugging. Now that we have the bot's response, we can clear out its typing status and send the message to the channel as a reply.\n\nThis ends the definition of our client.on_message call. Down here, we log in using the Discord token. Now let's invite the bot to our server. So we go to OAuth, check the bot. It's only permission is to send messages. We copy this, paste in a new browser window, and invite it to our server.\n\nGreat. Looks like we have another bot.\n\nRemember to click on \"Save Changes,\" otherwise, the bot's icon wouldn't be showing. Now that we have our bot, however, it's not logged in. So we need to go back to Repl to run our script. But before we run our Repl, let's make sure that the bot doesn't have access to the general channel, nor does it have access to the Python channel because it's not supposed to go there. So in permissions,\n\nwe find this ChattyBot JavaScript, remove its permission to send messages, and always remember to save the changes. We do the same thing for it on the Python channel.\n\nAnd go to the JS channel. This time, the one we need to remove is the Python bot. So this Python bot shouldn't be able to send messages to this JavaScript channel.\n\nNow we go back to run our Repl.it.\n\nIf you see this error, this means that the Discord version that npm is trying to install is wrong. You can see that there are those warnings that the newest Discord module is not compatible with Repl.it's version of node or npm. So we need to manually change something in package.json. So here, we just use the older version and rerun it.\n\nNow that we are logged in as ChattyBot JavaScript 1048, let's go back to our Discord channel. Cool. The ChattyBot is also online. Let's see if it responds to our messages.\n\nAll right. So this is now an error message telling us that the model is still loading. The model will usually take one or two minutes to load, so let's give it some time.\n\nGreat. Looks like our bot is responding to us.\n\nAnd because we have set the bot's permissions correctly, the Python bot is not responding to any messages here, and the JavaScript bot shouldn't be able to talk here.\n\nAnd in our general channel, no bot is ever allowed to talk here. Cool. So now we have successfully built the bot both in Python and in JavaScript.\n\nOne thing to note is that if I close the browser tab for the Python bot,\n\nthe bot is no longer responding, although it still shows that the bot is online. So in the next part, we're going to look at how to keep the bot running indefinitely in the browser, even when we close the browser tab.\n\nIn order to get our bot to run indefinitely, we need to create a web server in Repl.it and set up a service called Uptime Robot to continuously ping the web server. So this is for the Python bot, and we create a new file called keep_alive.py.\n\nAnd we add the code for a web server like this.\n\nAnd in our main.py, we import that part.\n\nAnd down here in the main function, right before the bot runs, we ask it to be kept alive.\n\nAnd we run it.\n\nWhen the code runs, we see a URL shown in this tab, and we copy this URL and bring it to our Uptime Robot service. So here is the Uptime Robot website, and I already have an account, so I'll just go to my dashboard and add a new monitor. Monitor type is going to be HTTPS, friendly name Discord Python bot, the URL is the one we copied from here, and the monitoring level will be a ping every five minutes. That should be sufficient. And finally, we create monitor.\n\nAnd close it. Now, let's see if our Python bot is capable of running indefinitely.\n\nAll right. I'm going to close this tab containing my Python script.\n\nAnd it looks like our model is still up. It's just that after some time, the model on Hugging Face backend will reload, but because the bot itself is responding, we know that our web server approach has worked.\n\nNow, let's repeat this process for the JavaScript bot.\n\nWe create a new file called server.js, and copy paste this code.\n\nThen we import this part from the file that we just created.\n\nFinally, right before the bot runs, we are going to call keep_alive. We stop the service and run it.\n\nAll right. The server is now ready. We copy this URL, go to Uptime Robot, and add a new monitor. It's again an HTTP monitor, Discord JS bot, and the URL is like this, and we create a monitor.\n\nNow we can safely close this browser window and go back to our Discord chat.\n\nAnd the bot is still running.\n\nGreat. Now we're all done. We have a cool Python chatbot and a cool JavaScript chatbot that can run indefinitely. I hope you enjoyed this video. Please subscribe for more content like this, and I'll see you in the next one.",
  "summary": "This tutorial demonstrates how to create a Discord chatbot using artificial intelligence to mimic the speech patterns of a chosen character. The instructor, Lynn, a software engineer and game developer, aims to provide a more comprehensive guide than previous versions.  The tutorial covers building the bot in both Python and JavaScript.\n\nThe first step involves finding data for the chosen character.  Lynn suggests Kaggle for pre-made dialogue datasets (demonstrated with Rick and Morty and Harry Potter examples). If a dataset isn't available, she recommends Transcript Wiki or a targeted Google search for raw transcripts.  The raw transcripts are then processed using Google Colab and regular expressions to create a two-column dataset (character name and line).  This is shown using a Peppa Pig example.\n\nNext, the model is trained using a pre-trained GPT model (Microsoft's GPT-small is used for demonstration; medium models are recommended for production). Hyperparameters like the number of training epochs are discussed; increasing epochs leads to smarter models but may increase training time.  The model is fine-tuned and tested using training and test datasets to prevent overfitting.  The resulting model is pushed to Hugging Face.\n\nFinally, the chatbot is integrated into Discord, with separate channels created for Python and JavaScript bots to prevent cross-talk.  The tutorial shows setting up the bot, handling API tokens (Hugging Face and Discord), and managing bot permissions to restrict channel access. A keep-alive web server is implemented (using Repl.it and Uptime Robot) to ensure the bot runs continuously, even when the browser tab is closed.  The final result is two functional Discord chatbots that can continuously interact with users.",
