Support your local PBS station here: http://www.pbs.org/donate​.\n\nIn 2020, the journalism nonprofit Forbidden Stories and Amnesty International gained access to a leaked list of more than 50,000 phone numbers. They suspected it contained numbers selected for potential surveillance with Pegasus. The Pegasus Project reporting consortium — which was led by Forbidden Stories and included 16 other media organizations, FRONTLINE among them — found that the spyware had been used on journalists, human rights activists, the wife and fiancée of the murdered Saudi columnist Jamal Khashoggi, and others.\n\nOver two nights, this docuseries reveals the inside story of an investigation that prompted probes by governments and institutions around the world and sparked calls for an international treaty to govern the largely unregulated spyware industry.\n\nNSO, which has disputed some of the Pegasus Project’s reporting, says that its technology was not associated in any way with Khashoggi’s murder and that it sells Pegasus to vetted governments for “the sole purpose of preventing and investigating terror and serious crime.”\n\nSurveillance technologies like Pegasus are “a military weapon used against civilians, and the civilians, they don’t have any mechanism to help them in seeking justice,” says Laurent Richard, founder of Forbidden Stories and Forbidden Films and one of the producers of the films.\n\nPart two of “Global Spyware Scandal: Exposing Pegasus” premieres Tues., Jan. 10, 2023.\n\nLearn more: https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/documentary/global-spyware-scandal-exposing-pegasus/\n\n#Documentary #Spyware #Surveillance\n\nFind FRONTLINE on the PBS App, where more than 300 of our documentaries are available to watch any time: https://to.pbs.org/FLVideoApp \nSubscribe on YouTube: http://bit.ly/1BycsJW \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/frontlinepbs \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/frontlinepbs \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/frontline \n\n“Global Spyware Scandal: Exposing Pegasus” is a FRONTLINE production with Forbidden Films.

        "full_text": "Pegasus. Pegasus. Pegasus. Pegasus, which has been used to monitor and track journalists, human rights activists and dissidents across the globe. In collaboration with Forbidden Films, a two-part investigation. We immediately realized that this story would be huge. NSO was established with the ambition to make the world a safer place into powerful spyware. It's a military weapon used against civilians. This is extremely serious for democracies, used around the world. There is no control over how countries use it and they have been using it in the worst way you could imagine. Now on Frontline, part one of Global Spyware Scandal, exposing Pegasus. Our phones are not just our phones. We call them phones, but they're not phones, they're computers. And they're like extensions of our body. They're with us all of the time. And if they are turned into a surveillance device, I don't think it's an exaggeration to say this was something that even George Orwell in 1984 couldn't imagine. It's beyond science fiction. Il va se faire un brief. La base de données est vraiment explosive. Pegasus. Pegasus. Pegasus. Pegasus. This technology is so far ahead of government regulation, and even of public understanding of what's happening out there. All of us suspected that if NSO group was giving authoritarian and repressive regimes such a powerful instrument of surveillance that it was pretty likely that this technology would be abused. But none of us had been able to prove it on a systemic scale. De acuerdo con la pesquisa recavada por The Washington Post, The Guardian, Lemon y otros medios, the joint investigation by 17 news outlets and activists, lawyers and journalists are reportedly among those who have been targeted by the phone phone numbers belonging to some big name politicians. What you have here, Huang Shi, Cheng Yan, Zheng Dang Yao Ren, and Bu Fen Ji Zhi, De Shouji. The device that you have in your pocket could be a spy that is spying on your life. The list doesn't have any names. You have phone numbers, area country code, some time stamps as well. And it's a list that is about 50,000 phone numbers from 2016 to 2020. We can't explain were the list is coming from. We can't of course reveal who is our source. Officially the Pegasus spyware is not working on any plus one US phone numbers. It's not possible. The numbers they are mostly in 10 countries and most of these governments are known to be clients of NSO Group who make Pegasus. Pegasus designed to infect phones like iPhones or Androids and once in the phone, it can extract and access everything from the device: the phone books, geolocation, the messages, the photos, even the encrypted messages sent by Signal or WhatsApp. It can even access the mic or the camera of your phone remotely. It's like a person over your shoulder, a person who will see what you are seeing, a person who will watch what you are watching. Your emails, your encrypted communication, everything. So once you are infected, you're trapped. Hello, can you hear me? I can hear you. I don't see you. Hello. Hello. I don't know. Hi, how are you? Good, and you? We decided to reach out to some partners, The Washington Post, The Guardian and many other ones. We wanted to tell you about some information we have and about a new project we are starting. We had no names attached to the numbers. We needed more journalists. We needed reporters on the ground who could reach out to some victims. We need people with tech expertise. We still have to identify numbers. Many of them actually haven't been identified yet, so we'll need your help on this. The moment they mentioned the numbers of phone numbers that they had, the quantity of phone numbers, tens of thousands. I mean, my jaw just hit the floor. There is a lot that concern India, some people in Mexico, information about Hungary, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan. If Forbidden Stories have got data that can identify not just who the customers of NSO are, but potentially pointing the direction of who the targets are as well, this is a game changer. This could be transformative in terms of our understanding of the whole cyber surveillance industry. We specialized in national security reporting. So surveillance is part of my beat, so to speak. You could see patterns starting to emerge and you could almost like touch, okay, that might be a story. You know, here's something that's happening in Azerbaijan. That might be a story. Okay, I see what the Moroccan story might be. It's like watching a photo emerge in a dark room. You will change here, at Brighton, and from here, it will be the and We at The Guardian have been reporting about NSO for a long time. We thought it was really important to hold this company to account. Israel has become a world leader in this industry and exports these tools all over the world. And if you like NSO Group was in many ways, you know, the jewel in the crown. The NSO Group was recently valued at $1 billion. It is one of the most successful companies in Israel startup space. NSO says they sell the software to governments around the world for legitimate purposes fighting terrorism or violating local laws. Here was a company founded by three guys in 2010 that claimed to have 40 countries around the world buying its technology that made bold claims about its technology being used to solve serious crimes and help facilitate national security inquiries. This was a big deal. I can tell you, in the last 10 years, we only found three cases of misuse and we took very serious actions that we are always taking. And these serious actions meant that we shut down the system completely. We only sell it to government or to entities that we know or we want to believe that they will not misuse the tools. And this is how we check the customer, this is how we diligence them. We have all the mechanism to make sure that they are not misusing the system. In the middle of Paris, in the middle of this big COVID crisis, we got everyone together to plan the investigation. Thank you. Sorry about that. I'm Dana Priest at The Washington Post and this is uh Craig Timberg who's joining me. Here is Carmen Aristegui, Sebastian Barragan from Aristegui Noticias. This is a Paul Lewis in The Guardian and Steph, many of you will know, writes a lot about NSO. This is uh The Le Monde corner. This is Martin, Kristoff, and I'm Damien. Usually, we see reporters at other news organizations as our rivals. We compete against them. We never want to share information with them because, you know, we want to keep our stories to ourselves. And this is just a different way of operating. This is seeing other journalists as partners. We are really one group, one group with one goal. We worked with more than 80 journalists and we set up a publication date of July 2021. That gave us about a year to investigate the list. We want even in order to protect the source. That's clearly something that is The main task for us and for all the partners was to identify the names behind the phone numbers. That was crucial. With phone numbers only we can do nothing. The data is the beginning of the project. We need to find sources. We need to go on the field. This project is about who is spying on who in many countries and those countries most of them are very dangerous. We had a kaleidoscope of potential victims. We have the data, but how do we prove that Pegasus was on the phones? And that was always going to be the hardest thing about this project, which was we had data, which is a very good indication of who the persons of interest were to these government clients of NSO. But we couldn't know whether a phone had been hacked unless we conducted forensics on it. Claudio Guarnieri is the head of Amnesty International's Security Lab. He worked on creating a methodology, a platform that we could use during our investigation to have phones analyzed. He's a key element of that investigation. Without his expertise, nobody in our team would have been able to detect traces of Pegasus in a phone. It's a piece of code that look very similar to all the others that you are running on your phone. It's just designed to do something that it shouldn't. Pegasus access and files on the device, access and records on the device being from WhatsApp, being from uh the SMS uh on the database that you have on the phone, or access the GPS of the device, record the audio, access the webcam, these kinds of things. Apple and companies like it try to create as many layers of complication as possible for an attacker. But the unfortunate reality is that against capabilities like those that uh Pegasus customers have, there's not much you can do from a digital security perspective. You can't really stop them meaningfully. You can only try to make it more complicated. At some point, we discovered on very crucial information. An information that changed entirely the project. For years, we heard rumors about the Pegasus spyware might have been used against Jamal Khashoggi who was killed in 2018 in a consulate of the Saudis in Istanbul. The minute we found out about this list, the first thing we all did was to check for any numbers related to Jamal Khashoggi or anyone we knew who was associated with him. And right away we found two numbers associated with the two women closest to him in his life. Jamal Khashoggi's murder really in the history of The Post stands out. He was an opinion writer for The Washington Post, very gentle, soft-spoken man. His voice became very important because he was the single most important dissident writing about the Saudi regime. Jamal, let me start with you. You've compared your Crown Prince to Putin, to Iran's supreme leader. You've said he's creating quote an interesting form of dictatorship. How so? I still see him as a reformer, but he is gathering all power within his hand. As we speak today, there are Saudi intellectuals and journalists jailed. His murder was so cold-blooded and we we still don't have the whole story. Jamal went to the consulate in Istanbul. And then he disappeared. Senior Turkish officials have reported that he is, in fact, in the building. And he is still here. His close friends and family are still trying to figure out what this situation is. There's waiting on an official statement. I spoke to his fiance who was also here who told us that they came here to issue a number of documents so they could marry. They dispatched an assassination team that landed in a plane in the in the airport and came in cars with tools to hack him up, to hack his bones and carry him out in a suitcase or suitcases. Pretty soon after his murder, people started asking, was Pegasus used against Jamal? The word is that NSO sold Pegasus to them and then they turned it around to get Khashoggi. Khashoggi's murder is horrible, really horrible. And therefore, when I first heard their accusations that our technology been used on Jamal Khashoggi or on his relatives, I started an immediate check about it. And I can tell you very clear, we had nothing to do with this horrible murder. I'm hoping that Hatice Khashoggi's fiance, who we'd all gotten to know on television because she was outside the consulate when he didn't reappear. I'm hoping that Hatice will let us do forensics on her phone to see for certain whether she was targeted and maybe if we get lucky, whether we can see what they took out of her phone. They killed my future. They killed my life. I felt inside me something changed and broke. Do you feel like your phone is doing anything strange? Do you think it could be hacked? We can test it, so we could do that if if you wanted to do it, we Okay, you can do that. Okay. That'd be great. We just need to plug your phone into our computer. Okay. So maybe we'd do that. Great. Hello. Claudio. Hi. Dana. Hi, how are you? I don't know. You tell me. So, I checked both the uploads. The new one seems clean. The old one however has some traces on the 6th of October of 2018 seems to have been first compromised, which was followed by some additional traces on the 9th and then on the 12th. There's also an additional record in June of 2019, but that seems to be probably a failed attempt. And I don't see anything following that. Okay. The analysis proved that the phone belonging to Jamal Khashoggi's fiance had been infected with Pegasus. Then we find out the date, which is four days after his murder when she's still trying to figure out what's happening. And it just seemed like such a ballsy move to surveil the person who has become the public face of his disappearance. We learned that Jamal had a complicated personal life. Hanan Atar is probably the least known character in Jamal Khashoggi's life. She's actually his wife and most people have not heard of her. He had secretly married in the United States in an Islamic ceremony. What I discovered is Hanan is living in hiding in the United States while she waits for her political asylum case. She was a flight attendant for Emirates Airlines. And so she flew all over the world and she was communicating with him on foreign phones. He was so happy, and I was so happy as well. This is in his birthday in a restaurant in Washington, and his friend Maggie behind us, the one she made the birthday party. This is all of his friends around us. This last birthday in his life. He was careful, but he didn't realize maybe my device is much dangerous. And I didn't know as well. He suspect but he's not sure, and I'm not sure as well. She allowed me to download her phone to send a copy to Claudio and to Bill Marczak at Citizen Lab who also conducts forensic analysis. What I did is I analyzed all the available data on uh two Android phones and and one laptop uh belonging to Hanan. On one of the phones, uh it appears that uh there were two separate uh links to the Pegasus spyware that were actually opened that shows that she was. Before Jamal's murder, Hanan had been detained and interrogated in the United Arab Emirates, which is of course a close ally of Saudi Arabia. They took me to uh office in airport. Then they took me to my house. They searched the whole house. They took my devices, my family devices. They have the password. I was in investigation for 17 hours until I got tired. I slept in the floor. What Bill discovered was when she was detained at the at the UAE airport, somebody who took her phone then opened a browser on her phone and then typed in a URL that then directed the phone to a website known to Citizen Lab as being a Pegasus website that activates the infection. The link to Pegasus was actually typed into the web browser character by character. They made a couple typos actually while they were doing it, which tells me it was done manually. We have the smoking gun from Hanan's phone, which is the traces of the spyware. You know, almost certainly this spyware was installed and uh exfiltrated information from from her phone. So she was uh in my view monitored. He was telling me what he's doing and what his connection, what his movement, what is his state of mind. So you were communicating with him? A lot. They tracked my husband through me long time back before they killed him. Because he was telling me, only me, everything. I didn't know this much they tracked him through me all the time. Mhm. Yeah. Why is this all come in my life? They did track Jamal and they killed him through me. Long time back. Getting evidence on the device of Hanan, on the device of Hatice. All of that was breaking the narrative of the CEO of NSO Group who told to the press that that spyware were never used against the Jamal or the relatives of Jamal. In the list, we saw more than 15,000 Mexican numbers. Mexico was among the very first customers of NSO Group. One of Mexico's best known journalists is Carmen Aristegui. And she was part of our investigation. She has maybe more followers than the President of Mexico. And uh we needed to understand who those phone numbers in Mexico belongs to. Hola. Hola, Carmen, Zarzuela de Forbidden Stories. ¿Cómo estás? ¿Cómo estás? Qué gusto. Forbidden tuvo un universo de más de 50.000 números. Pero había que saber de quién eran esos números. Se tenía que investigar uno por uno. Y Carmen, hay muchos contactos en tu teléfono en nuestra lista. Uf, okay. Lo que lo que podemos hacer ahora es que puedes eh entrar los números en tu teléfono para decirme a quién pertenecen los números. Así lo vamos a hacer. Tengo un directorio nutrido y entonces ese directorio lo cruzamos con los números de Forbidden y los números de mi directorio. El tercero es Sandra Nogales. Que durante muchos años fue mi asistente. Ah, caray. Tengo aquí una cosa, una sorpresa. El séptimo número corresponde a Karina Maciel. Karina Maciel es la productora de mi programa en la cadena de televisión CNN en México. Otro colega periodista de la revista Proceso, Alejandro Caballero. Al cruzar, empezaron a salir nombres, nombres, nombres, nombres, nombres. Y nosotros decíamos, ¿Hasta dónde va a terminar esto? Ah, caray. El que sigue es Alejandro Encinas. Es un muy importante político de la izquierda. Y estaban ahí políticos, diplomáticos, abogados, periodistas, activistas, defensores de derechos humanos. Ah, caray. Bueno, aquí te puedo decir que está mi hermana. Aquí aparece mi hermana Teresa Aristegui Flores. Es mi hermana, pero no está relacionada con ninguna actividad eh pública. Yo intuyo que aquí nadie se salva. Si hicieron esto, imagínate ya perdieron el pudor, o sea, podían haber espiado a su gato, ¿no? Sí. A su perro, al canario. O sea, ¿Estás de acuerdo? A su propia a su propia familia. We knew from a previous investigation that Carmen's phone was heavily targeted with Pegasus in 2015 and 2016. So from that date, she is still investigating NSO Group, the Pegasus spyware, all the agents and operators who are using that in Mexico. Durante los años que fui espiada, estuvimos realizando investigaciones periodísticas importantes para México, relacionadas eh con la Casa Blanca del presidente Enrique Peña Nieto. Una casa en un barrio muy lujoso de la ciudad de México en posesión del presidente de México, de Enrique Peña Nieto y su familia que no podían explicar. Que desde luego no podía haber obtenido el presidente con los ingresos que el presidente pudo haber tenido como presidente, como gobernador o como hijo de una familia de clase media. que yo sospecho que mi teléfono está intervenido y el teléfono de mi hijo Emilio está intervenido es cuando Emilio un chico menor de edad, me pregunta, \"Oye, mamá, eh, ¿tú sabes por qué recibo estos mensajes tan extraños?\" Y yo le digo, \"Yo también estoy recibiendo mensajes extraños.\" Quisieras click para ver algún problema de tu visa en Estados Unidos. ¿Qué puede estar mal con tu visa, ¿no? Sí, pero era imposible que no hicieras click. A ver, yo veía mi visa y decía, \"Pues ¿qué vigencia tiene?\" Tiene. Fuera de la vigencia, ¿qué problema puede tener? Pero, ¿sabes? Es algo que es inevitable que que hagas. Que la expliques. Sabemos que Pegasus se vendió a la Procuraduría General de la República. Se vendió Pegasus al ejército. Eh, se vendió Pegasus al Cisén, al sistema de inteligencia. Se vendió Pegasus a algunas instancias de carácter público. No puedo decirles mi nombre. No puedo referir con exactitud la institución en la cual me desempeñé. Y puede resultar peligroso para mí la identificación y el conocimiento de que yo tengo o tuve acceso a cierta información. El sistema Pegasus era toda una novedad para nosotros. El procedimiento era tener el número del objetivo. Hacer lo que se denominaba la ingeniería social, que es búsqueda de información en fuentes abiertas del objetivo. Con la finalidad de elaborar mensajes de texto que pudieran ser enviados al dispositivo móvil. Debería ser uno o dos intentos muy precisos con información que le resultara útil al objetivo y que este pudiera dar click. Si lográbamos el el éxito que diera click en el mensaje, eso automáticamente instalaba el software en el equipo móvil. Y a partir de allí, ya podíamos tener acceso al teléfono, toda la información. Los resultados eran increíbles, porque una vez que se lograba instalar, infectar el dispositivo, se tenía acceso pleno al equipo móvil. Era una pantalla negra. En la parte superior izquierda, teníamos la visualización principal. Y en la parte del lado derecho, abajo estaban, digamos, módulos o pestañas en donde se tenía cada una de las aplicaciones de las que se extraía información. Por ejemplo, teníamos el cuadro de la aplicación de WhatsApp, Telegram. Abajo teníamos el micrófono, las cámaras, la geolocalización, y dependiendo de lo que nos interesara, le dábamos click. Y era lo que se proyectaba en la visualización principal. A partir de la infección, cualquier información que sea eliminada, podemos verla nosotros. Ya sean fotos o conversaciones, pero podemos seguir viéndolas. Cuando empiezas a saber qué cosa es Pegasus, te vas de espaldas. Quedas desnudo frente a un poder que no sabes quién detenta. Eh, quedas eh vulnerable frente a alguien que está observándote bajo una lupa. Pueden estar contigo eh en la oficina, en la regadera, en la cocina, con un amigo, con una fuente, todo el tiempo. All the time during this investigation we tried everyday to identify the person behind that phone number. This is what all the partners and the Forbidden team were doing most of the time. Basically, the consortium had access to a list so of of potential targets. Exactly. To be sure that you were indeed infected or surveilled, we would have to run forensic analysis. I want I don't trust to talk and I I don't know if by giving a call to you it will help me. I don't know because I don't trust the government anymore. So I did not want to put myself or my family under risk. I I reached your stage. I realized. Sorry. No. Yeah, in this country. No, I cannot trust you. You will ask me. And I will be angry. Of course. Of course. I saw one number in the list that belonged to a friend, a journalist in Azerbaijan. Her name is Khadija Ismayilova. She's an award-winning investigative reporter and an outspoken critic of the government, renowned for her exposés of corruption at the hands of the country's president. Azerbaijan, you have a lot of oil and gas. It's a dictatorship and the dictator's name is Ilham Aliyev. And this person, and this state is extremely violent against dissidents, political opponents, journalists. I first met Khadija Ismayilova in Azerbaijan in about 2006, 2007. Khadija Ismayilova relentlessly kept on exposing the wrongdoing and the corruption of the Aliyev regime. She showed how, you know, they were having their hands into a big chunk of the Azerbaijani economy. She was showing how they were, you know, taking money in a covert way, how they were stealing money basically from the people. After all this investigative reporting, Khadija became a prime target for the government in Baku and for the Aliyevs. I don't know how to to proceed with Khadija because I don't want us to put Khadija in danger. The thing that is quite difficult is how to get in touch with Khadija uh without communicating on electronic device. This is very sensitive. Yeah. This is very, very sensitive, especially for her because she's basically on probation. That's gonna be a risk anyway. We learned that Khadija was about to go to Turkey for some personal reasons. And so we set up immediately a team who went to Turkey to meet Khadija once she landed in the airport. I'm nervous. I'm nervous too. I cannot stand still. Yeah. Hello. Yeah. So we have about 1,000 number from Azerbaijan. And you are among them. Oh. And then we also have some people who are your friends. Okay. Um and what does that program do? So what the program does is it basically without you knowing, um, it it it it installs things on your phone. And then it allows even if I didn't click on anything. Yes. So the the secrecy of this it's called Pegasus. And the secrecy of it is that you don't actually see or you you don't do anything. So before you had to you had to click on something to be infected. In this case, it all happens in the background. And you have no idea that you're infected. And when you're infected, it's transmitting your messages, your images, everything that happened on your phone, including on Signal, because they have the phone itself. And it's legal to sell it. Yes. So, um, we what we know is that most likely sometimes in 2018, the government got it. Okay. And we have a lot of data from 2019. Um and you know, that was a big year of protests. You were on a hunger strike with other people. Yeah. You guys had a woman march. You were leading the march. So one way for us to verify that you know, what exactly you know, was done in your case, would be to do forensic on your phone. Yeah. Why not? Is there any way to avoid this surveillance or not? Yes, we've also set you up with a new device, um that you will be able to use. For me, no. No phone. C, the balcony. Allows me some way, you know, to to do it, but there are other ways to communicate. Yeah. Yeah. It's like It's makes you to one to leave in the bubble. But then like, so no one can enter like, in some sort of And then like, living like living in the in the inside the condom. But then you cannot reproduce. This is her phone. You don't need any cables. No. Okay. Hopefully it works. So right now I am navigating through the phone. So I'm looking for things that might have executed, network activity that is connectable to the company. Any leftovers of malicious executions. Um accounts that we know of. Anything essentially that tells me the history of this phone. That's interesting. That's not something I've seen before. We see processes that we know are connected to to Pegasus. We see some message accounts that um that are connected to the attacks. Because this might indicate what was the entry point. Oh, was Apple Music? What the Oh, really? That's that's weird. So they might have started using Apple Music to exploit it. Um I have to do some more digging on this because I need to look up like what specifically these applications are. She's definitely among the ones most targeted. It's important to rectify this story which is that these technologies are exclusively used for good purposes and for fighting evil and for fighting crime and terrorism and all that. Okay, so no, Khadija is coming. Hi, Claudio. Hi. So now tell me how bad it is. Okay, um there are definitely some records uh that that indicate various points where the phone uh seem to have been compromised. Mhm. So I started feeling like I played doctor in 1300. I'm basically kind of just keeping the death count. I'm contributing to creating a trauma here. And I can see it in many cases. Like I can see it that they are right now they're going to a dramatic moment. And I'm like that person in the room that is breaking it. Um there are also some more recent records from even as recent as early May of this year, so until a couple of weeks ago. Um but all in all it seems like this probably extended between 2019 and 2020 2020 at the very least. I've been told that you will not know what exactly had been uh monitored or uh recorded. Yeah, thank you. Have a good day. Bye bye. Bye. That's not great news. All night I've been thinking about what did I do with my phone? And I feel guilty. I feel guilty to for the messages I've sent. I've feel guilty for the information sources that who send me thinking that some encrypted messaging ways are secure. They did it. And they didn't know that my phone is infected. I mean my family members are uh also victimized. The the sources are victimized. Everyone I mean, people I've been working with, people who told me they have private secrets are victimized. Every I mean, it's not just me. I I put so many people in danger. And and and I'm angry. I again, I'm angry. I'm angry with the government. I'm angry with the companies that produce all these tools and sell it to the bad guys like Aliyev regime. It it's it's really it's despicable. It's heinous. Khadija is not a terrorist. Khadija is not a criminal. She's a journalist that is taking a lot of risk to write some stories to make sure people will get access to independent information. So that was one more evidence of the global misuse of that spyware. Powerful governments managed to retain their power by seeing off threats from people who are campaigning for democracy or holding them to account, or telling the truth. And, you know, here's a company that gave them the tool to do that. It's a military weapon used against civilians.

      "summary": "The transcript details the pervasive use of Pegasus spyware, developed by the Israeli NSO Group, to clandestinely monitor journalists, human rights activists, and dissidents globally. Initially founded with the ambition to enhance global safety, NSO's powerful spyware is now characterized as a \"military weapon used against civilians,\" raising significant international concern over its lack of regulation and potential for abuse by authoritarian regimes. A joint investigation, spearheaded by Forbidden Films and featuring collaborations with 17 news outlets including The Washington Post, The Guardian, and Le Monde, unveiled a list of 50,000 targeted phone numbers from 2016 to 2020, revealing the scale of this cyber surveillance.\n\nThe investigation highlighted Pegasus's advanced capabilities, which allow it to infect iPhones and Androids, turning them into comprehensive surveillance devices. Once installed, it can extract all data, including encrypted messages from Signal and WhatsApp, access geolocation, record audio, and remotely control the phone's microphone and camera. Despite NSO's claims that its software is sold only to governments for legitimate purposes like fighting terrorism and serious crime, and that it has strict mechanisms to prevent misuse (citing only three cases of misuse in a decade), the findings suggest widespread abuse.\n\nKey to the investigation was the challenging task of identifying the individuals behind the phone numbers and conducting forensic analysis to prove Pegasus infection. Claudio Guarnieri, head of Amnesty International's Security Lab, developed the crucial methodology for phone analysis. The project, involving over 80 journalists who set aside professional rivalries to collaborate, uncovered alarming patterns, including potential targeting of individuals associated with Jamal Khashoggi, the Washington Post opinion writer murdered in 2018, whose critical voice against the Saudi regime made him a key target.",

Support your local PBS station here: http://www.pbs.org/donate​.\n\nIn 2020, the journalism nonprofit Forbidden Stories and Amnesty International gained access to a leaked list of more than 50,000 phone numbers. They suspected it contained numbers selected for potential surveillance with Pegasus. The Pegasus Project reporting consortium — which was led by Forbidden Stories and included 16 other media organizations, FRONTLINE among them — found that the spyware had been used on journalists, human rights activists, the wife and fiancée of the murdered Saudi columnist Jamal Khashoggi, and others.\n\nOver two parts, this docuseries reveals the inside story of an investigation that prompted probes by governments and institutions around the world and sparked calls for an international treaty to govern the largely unregulated spyware industry.\n\nNSO, which has disputed some of the Pegasus Project’s reporting, says that its technology was not associated in any way with Khashoggi’s murder and that it sells Pegasus to vetted governments for “the sole purpose of preventing and investigating terror and serious crime.”\n\nPart one of “Global Spyware Scandal: Exposing Pegasus” is available to stream here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZVj1_SE4Mo\n\nLearn more: https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/documentary/global-spyware-scandal-exposing-pegasus/\n\n#Documentary #Spyware #Surveillance\n\nFind FRONTLINE on the PBS App, where more than 300 of our documentaries are available to watch any time: https://to.pbs.org/FLVideoApp \nSubscribe on YouTube: http://bit.ly/1BycsJW \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/frontlinepbs \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/frontlinepbs \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/frontline \n\n“Global Spyware Scandal: Exposing Pegasus” is a FRONTLINE production with Forbidden Films.

        "full_text": "Pegasus. Pegasus. In collaboration with Forbidden Films, a two-part investigation. This story would be huge. NSO was established with the ambition to make the world a safer place into powerful spyware. It's a military weapon used against civilians. used around the world. There is no control over how countries use it. And they have been using it in the worst way you could imagine. Now on Frontline, part two of Global Spyware Scandal, exposing Pegasus. When you have your hands on a technology like this, the power must be quite intoxicating. You can get into the phone of most people in the world. And no one's looking over your shoulder. On va se faire un brief. La base de données est vraiment explosive. Pegasus. Pegasus. Pegasus. It's like a person over your shoulder, a person who will see what you are seeing, a person who will watch what you are watching. Your emails, your encrypted communication, everything. So once you are infected, you're trapped. It was against so many people in civil society who clearly were not terrorists or criminals. And you got a real sense that it was a free-for-all. De acuerdo con la pesquisa recabada por The Washington Post, The Guardian, Le Monde y otros medios, A joint investigation by 17 news outlets and Forbidden Stories. Activists, lawyers and journalists are reportedly among those who've been targeted by the phone. phone numbers belonging to some big name politicians. NSO says they sell the software to governments for legitimate purposes, fighting terrorism or violating local laws. You have here a go-to spy service for tyrants. Oui, oui. Après je comprends tout à fait si vous souhaitez pas le, pas le faire aussi bien entendu votre droit le plus strict et Au revoir. Je pense qu'il va dire non lui. Il se trouve que parmi les personnes qui figurent dans la liste, il y a un ancien ministre qui n'est plus au gouvernement et qui donc a une, une forme de liberté un peu plus grande que quelqu'un qui serait encore actuellement au pouvoir et c'est François de Rugy. Donc on a contacté François de Rugy en lui expliquant qu'on souhaitait parler de quelque chose d'extrêmement confidentiel. Vous êtes pas le seul ministre ou ex-ministre concerné, on en a au total 14. Et donc à son crédit, il a il a fini par accepter et donc on s'est revu pour procéder à à l'analyse technique de de son téléphone et qui nous a permis de confirmer qu'effectivement il avait bien été ciblé et qu'il avait bien été ciblé par le client qu'on avait identifié comme étant le royaume du Maroc. Il n'a pas eu l'air du tout surpris quand je lui ai annoncé le pays. Ah bon. Il m'a dit qu'il a rencontré le roi, ce qui est à mon avis une bonne manière de le mettre sur les radars de ces gens. Le numéro de téléphone qui est attribué à Emmanuel Macron, la première étape ça a été de vérifier que le numéro était encore actif aujourd'hui et que c'était bien toujours Emmanuel Macron qui l'utilisait. Et donc le moyen le plus simple de vérifier si il l'utilise toujours, c'est de lui écrire, donc en fait on va envoyer un SMS à Emmanuel Macron. Monsieur le Président de la République. Nous publions la nouvelle enquête internationale. sur le cyber. Hmm hmm. Donc vous-même avez été la cible ? Donc vous-même avez été la cible. C'est plus clair, soyons clair. En plus c'est pour ça. C'est ça que vous allez lui dire. Ah bah oui. Donc vous avez été la cible. Ah non. Ouais. C'est parti. Et donc Emmanuel Macron ne répond pas directement à ce SMS, mais une heure ou deux heures après avoir envoyé ce SMS, les services de l'Élysée nous rappellent à propos du SMS qui lui a été envoyé, donc il l'a bien reçu, le téléphone est toujours actif. Ouais, ouais, bah là on va à l'Élysée là. Quelques heures après avoir envoyé ce SMS à Emmanuel Macron, on a reçu une invitation à se rendre à l'Élysée. qui venait des services de l'État pour discuter de ce que nous avions trouvé. Bah, le rendez-vous quand même de ce matin, l'impression que ça nous a donné à tous, c'est vraiment le côté panique, enfin pas panique genre mon Dieu c'est horrible ce qu'il a pu se passer, mais c'est plutôt mon Dieu, toutes les implications potentielles de cette affaire sur Il faut et plans judiciaire, diplomatique, sécuritaire, euh voilà, et que, et que en fait euh ils verrouillent, ils verrouillent la la communication. Assez rapidement les experts de l'État vont confirmer qu'il y a bien eu des tentatives d'infection ou des infections dans certains cas sur les téléphones de certains ministres euh et sur les téléphones d'un certain nombre de très hauts fonctionnaires euh français. Le résultat des analyses du téléphone du président de la République est classé secret défense et on n'y aura vraiment jamais accès. We don't know exactly who in Morocco was using Pegasus. There were Moroccan dissidents on the list, even the King of Morocco himself was on the list. But we do know that NSO only sells to governments and government agencies. We were reaching out to another dimension of the project. We were at this stage entering a space, a dangerous space, where we were talking about a country, a state attacking another one. Each time you look at how a client of NSO Group used the technology, it tells you something about that government. In the UAE, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum is prime minister, vice president, and of course, the ruler of Dubai. Here is an autocratic leader, massively powerful. Princess Latifa is the daughter of Sheikh Muhammad. She had for a long time been, by her account, unhappy about her life in Dubai. She had been incarcerated effectively by her father's regime. I'm making this video because it could be the last video I make. Yeah. This video can help me because all my father cares about is his reputation. He will kill people to protect his own reputation. He he he only cares about himself and his ego. Princess Latifa concocted this extraordinary attempted escape that involved jet skis, a yacht and a trip to the Indian Ocean. I mean, it's an audacious thing to do. Incredible even that she attempted it. I think remarkable that it nearly succeeded. The day after Princess Latifa went missing from Dubai, we saw her number entered into the list. And in the days after that, as she was traveling toward India on this yacht, her friends, people she knew, people within her orbit, their phone numbers also appeared on the list. If you look at the dates and times that her number and those of people close to her were entered into the system, you have something that has to be more than a coincidence. Eight days after her escape, Indian special forces boarded the yacht, and then the princess was forcibly returned to Dubai. We don't know exactly why the attempted escape didn't succeed, but NSO's technology was, it seems, from the evidence we've seen, one of the tools that was being used by the state in a desperate attempt to find Princess Latifa, kidnap her and return her back to Dubai. We tried hard to get hold of a phone that Latifa had used but we couldn't. So we contacted her friends and her associates to ask if we could check their phones to see if they had been targeted with Pegasus. Given how much David Haig was working on the Latifa case, it wasn't a surprise when we discovered that there was Pegasus activity on his phone. I was infected on 3rd of August 2020 with Pegasus. I believe at 3:00 a.m. in the morning and the next day as well. The fact that you can be hacked on British soil, and that they can do that is frightening. It really is. My name's David Haigh from Detained International, then we founded the campaign to free the Dubai Princess, Princess Latifa in 2018. David Haigh was actually imprisoned in Dubai for alleged fraud, and it was after his release that he became a human rights campaigner. Princess Latifa began to message him after her failed attempted escape. This is a picture that Latifa drew of the jail villa, Villa 96 in Jumeirah, Dubai, near the Burj Al Arab. Um and you can see here at Beach this direction, where she was held captive. This villa has been converted into a jail. All the windows are boarded shut, I can't open any window. Uh there's five policemen outside and two policewoman inside the house. Uh I don't know what can happen to me and how long this will last and if they decide to release me, like how my life will be. But um, I'm not safe at all. That week before I'd hacked, our secret contact with Latifa had stopped suddenly. The several hours became a day and then two days. And then we started to worry because that was not normal. We had recorded a lot of videos and a lot of evidence Latifa had that could be used to tell the world about her predicament. The fact that she'd been held hostage. At the time I was hacked, we were in London with the videos that Latifa recorded, the evidence, to meet media to decide if we were going to use it at that time or not. It was effectively dynamite evidence on that phone. The fact that they know your location. That someone could be listening to us now and seeing what we're doing. And it's that sitting in the back of your head every day. We can't let NSO and the governments that abuse their system get away with what they've done. Because if we do and if nothing happens and people are not brought to justice, people are not put in jail and people are not taken to court. The next company and the next company and the next company wherever they may be, will do exactly the same. And it will just carry on, but get worse. The heart of the company is what we call vulnerability researchers. You take a system like the iPhone that the best engineers in the world worked on it, and you find a way to overcome it. But there is a well-oiled mechanism of recruiting army computer unit graduates to the civilian high-tech. To all kinds of companies. 8200 is a large unit within the army. And within that unit, they deal with offensive cyber of the Israel Defense Forces, of the IDF. When they need to extract information from our enemies, these are the people who will do it. They have knowledge that is rare. They take 18-year-old kids, train them very quickly, very deeply. Israel has this advantage of not only developing new technologies and weaponry, but testing it live. And this is something Israel knows it can use to sell outside. When you want to control a huge population like we do with Palestinians, you have to have assets everywhere. So everyone can be a target because you don't want only the, I don't know, terrorists from Hamas, but also maybe his neighbor or the his cousin or the person who sells milk in the corner of the street. If you want to recruit human agents, you need to collect their weaknesses, things that you can use to blackmail. And so part of what 8200 does is to collect this blackmail potential information about everybody. If your day or if you have medical, special medical condition or you have uh financial problems or someone from your family has one of those, then that's something we can use against you to blackmail you and get you to cooperate. Israeli intelligence has a strategic view of how their employees should be used after they leave their employ. They promote them. They want them to start these companies. And they see a deep communications, a continued relationship between the government and their former employees as valuable to Israel's national security interest. There's a lot of evidence to suggest that NSO Group had the the direct backing and support of Bibi Netanyahu's government. In order to sell its product to governments around the world, it required permits effectively, licenses from the Israeli Defense Ministry. I decided several years ago to turn Israel into one of the five uh cyber powers of the world. In order for the companies to develop, they need to make what do they need to make? Money. They need to make money. Now, the easiest way to make sure that they don't make money is one, high taxes, right? What's the other one? Regulations. Have you ever heard of regulations? We have a problem with regulations. So the policy we have is keep taxes low and keep regulations low. Minimize regulations. There is no industry more susceptible and more inviting of regulations than cybersecurity. It's like weapons. It is a weapon. The story of using a weapon as a diplomatic tool is not new in Israel. There is even a term for it. It's called diplomacy of the Uzi. And we found a match between the timelines between a visit of Netanyahu to a certain country or a visit of another country's leader to Israel, and the day when the NSO system was first operated in that country. Sometimes the system was operated before the state visit. Sometimes the state visit was before the system was operated. But the correlation was so strong that it cannot be ignored. One example is Hungary, which under the populist prime minister, Viktor Orbán, the country has become one of Israel's strongest allies in the European Union. The timeline for Hungary is that the visit was in July 2017. And the operation of Hungary, we know almost the exact date, by the database of Forbidden Stories, it's February 2018. So similarities. Through this list of phone numbers, you can find numbers from Morocco, from Bahrain, from the United Arab Emirates, and from Saudi Arabia. So we know that the State of Israel wanted to get closer to them. It wanted to warm up relations with them. Photos that Netanyahu, of course not in Saudi Arabia, which is still unofficial and still what they call relations behind the scenes, we see that the State of Israel is beginning to understand the value that NSO has, that Pegasus has for some countries that do not have strong intelligence services, that do not have good technological capabilities. And Israel uses Pegasus as a diplomatic currency. As something that it can give to countries that it wants something from. And that's how to warm up relations or to advance in negotiations. And essentially, this is my small contribution to this amazing project called Pegasus Project. Going through all the numbers on the list was a huge job. More than 15,000 of the numbers were in Mexico. And one of those numbers belonged to a journalist who was murdered just three weeks after he was put on the list. Was Pegasus used in that case to spy on the journalist or to geolocate him? Sabes que ese señor Pineda es también en la lista? Sí, el que es el que fue asesinado? Sí. Es en la lista, sí. Qué fuerte. En México es muy grave que se haya usado Pegasus como se usó. Me remito al caso de Cecilio Pineda. Y de Pegasus Project lo mostró públicamente que su teléfono fue ingresado días antes o semanas antes de haber sido cometido el asesinato. El estado de Guerrero es una de las entidades más impactadas por el crimen organizado. Hay lugares en donde literalmente el Estado ya no tiene dominio. Las autoridades en realidad están pues mezcladas con el crimen organizado. Y hay pues actividad del del narcotráfico, hay actividad diversa delincuencial. De acuerdo con el reporte de la policía, varios sujetos armados llegaron a un autolavado donde el periodista Cecilio Pineda esperaba que le entregaran su camioneta y le dispararon. No me sorprende que Cecilio Pineda estuviera en esa lista porque el tema que se estaba tocando era serio. y estamos cansados de violencia. Pero nadie eh tiene segura su vida. También es verdad vivimos en un entorno en donde estamos solos, en una región en donde todas autoridades pues no te no te apoyan, eh aquí uno tiene que defenderse con sus propias uñas. Buenas tardes, amigos de Tierra Caliente, pues aquí ya de regreso después de estar en dos municipios de la región y pues nos encontramos con esto. A Cecilio te había hecho un video. Venía en camino y quiso dar un mensaje anticipado de lo que iba a presentar después. Él dijo que unas horas después iba a mostrar el video de la relación que había entre el gobierno del Estado y el grupo del Tequilero. Después de eso ya no presentó nada. Ahí lo asesinaron. Ese día este fue Y ya al llegar a la clínica este yo quise pasar a verlo. Entonces me dice la señorita, dice, no, se lo están atendiendo. Entonces, yo pensé pues que iba a estar bien. Dije, no, pues nada más fue pues algo. Ya como a los a los tres minutos salió el doctor. Dice, no, dice, pues ya, ya falleció. Y es la única vez en mi vida que que me he desmayado. Cuando volví pues estaba toda aturdida, dije, pues no sabía qué. Y pues ya, fue cuando me volvieron a decir pues que había fallecido. Que este, que ya había llegado prácticamente casi muerto pues. You can only prove infection if you do forensics on the phone and find traces of Pegasus. But in many cases the phone was not findable. That was the case of Cecil Pineda. No se puede afirmar categóricamente que lo que se obtuvo de el posible espionaje haya sido lo que provocó el asesinato. Pero tampoco podemos ser ingenuos. In some ways, we can talk about the impact on the company and say it's been really profound. A more pessimistic view would be to look at the entire industry. Which remains unreformed, pretty wild, unregulated. NSO may vanish. But I feel no more secure talking in front of my phone now than I did when we first published. You know, I don't think these issues have gone away.",

      "summary": "The transcript details a comprehensive investigation, 'Global Spyware Scandal, exposing Pegasus,' a powerful spyware developed by NSO. Initially aiming to make the world safer, Pegasus has become a military weapon widely used against civilians, including activists, lawyers, journalists, and politicians, with no international control. The technology allows complete surveillance, accessing emails, encrypted communications, and user's visual data, effectively trapping the infected individual. This pervasive misuse led to a major joint investigation by 17 news outlets, including The Washington Post, The Guardian, Le Monde, and Forbidden Stories.\n\nThe investigation uncovered several high-profile targets. In France, former minister François de Rugy was confirmed to have been targeted by the Kingdom of Morocco, and analysis revealed that up to 14 ministers and ex-ministers were affected. The phone number of President Emmanuel Macron also appeared on the list, prompting an SMS inquiry that led to a high-level meeting at the Élysée. This meeting highlighted significant concerns regarding the judicial, diplomatic, and security implications, with state experts confirming infection attempts on phones of French officials, though the President's phone analysis was classified 'secret defense.'\n\nBeyond France, the scandal implicated the UAE in the case of Princess Latifa, daughter of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum of Dubai. Imprisoned by her father, Princess Latifa attempted a daring escape. Her phone number, and those of her associates, appeared on the Pegasus list around the time of her disappearance and during her journey. Indian special forces subsequently intercepted her yacht, and she was forcibly returned to Dubai, with Pegasus technology seemingly used as a key tool in her recapture. Human rights campaigner David Haigh, who was working to free Princess Latifa, also had his phone infected with Pegasus while on British soil, reinforcing concerns about the spyware's reach and lack of oversight.\n\nThe broader implications are severe: the technology allows autocratic leaders to track dissidents and suppress freedom, fostering a culture of fear among those targeted. The transcript emphasizes the critical need for accountability for NSO and the governments abusing Pegasus, warning that a failure to bring those responsible to justice will only encourage other companies to develop similar intrusive technologies, leading to a worsening global surveillance landscape. NSO's ability to compromise advanced systems like iPhones stems from its 'vulnerability researchers,' often recruited from specialized military units like Israel's Unit 8200, highlighting a pipeline from offensive cyber warfare to civilian high-tech.",

  "collection_summary": "Based on a comprehensive analysis of the provided video collection, the following intelligence assessment has been compiled.\n\n**INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS**\n\nThis two-part video collection from FRONTLINE constitutes a cohesive and methodically structured intelligence dossier on the global proliferation and impact of NSO Group's Pegasus spyware. The narrative is architected as a classic investigative reveal, where Part One serves as the foundational exposition, establishing the threat actor (NSO Group), the capability (Pegasus's total surveillance functions), the methodology of the investigation (the Forbidden Stories consortium), and the initial victimology focused on civil society—journalists, activists, and dissidents, exemplified by the targeting of individuals associated with Jamal Khashoggi. Part Two builds directly upon this foundation, escalating the narrative by presenting high-stakes case studies that demonstrate the strategic-level impact of the spyware. This progression from the general problem to specific, shocking applications creates a compelling and comprehensive information unit that is far more impactful than either video viewed in isolation.\n\nThe evolution of key entities across the collection reveals a deliberate strategy to escalate the perceived threat level. NSO Group is initially framed in Part One through its own corporate narrative—a tool for fighting terror—which is immediately challenged by evidence of its misuse against journalists. By Part Two, this characterization is significantly hardened; NSO is portrayed as a key enabler of state-level geopolitical power projection and transnational repression. This is substantiated by the implication of Morocco in targeting the French government and the UAE in the recapture of Princess Latifa. Similarly, the concept of the \"target\" evolves from a somewhat abstract group of dissidents in Part One to include the highest echelons of a G7 government (President Macron) and a high-profile royal figure in Part Two. This evolution effectively transforms the issue from a human rights concern into a critical matter of national sovereignty and international security.\n\nThe information architecture of the collection is highly logical and demonstrates a clear dependency between the two parts. Part One establishes the \"what\" and \"how\"—the technical capabilities of Pegasus and the forensic methodology developed by Amnesty International's Security Lab to prove infection. This technical groundwork is critical for the audience to grasp the significance of the revelations in Part Two, which focuses on the \"who\" and \"so what.\" The second video's impact, particularly the high-level meeting at the Élysée Palace, is predicated on the credibility and technical proof established in the first. The central contradiction—NSO's claims of strict oversight versus the investigation's evidence of widespread abuse—is not presented as a simple disagreement but as the core tension driving the entire scandal, with Part Two providing the most damning evidence against the company's official position.\n\nThematically, the collection explores the cascading consequences of the unchecked proliferation of military-grade cyberweapons into the commercial and geopolitical spheres. Part One centers on the themes of **human rights** and **freedom of the press**, demonstrating how spyware is used as a tool to silence dissent and create a \"culture of fear.\" Part Two expands these themes to include **national sovereignty** and the **accountability vacuum**. The targeting of French ministers and the use of Pegasus on British soil against David Haigh illustrate a direct challenge to the sovereignty of Western nations. Furthermore, the documentary pivots to the broader strategic implication: the pipeline of talent from elite military intelligence units like Israel's Unit 8200 to private firms like NSO is creating a new, powerful, and dangerously unregulated class of global actor, blurring the lines between state-sponsored and commercially-enabled espionage.\n\nThe primary intelligence value of this collection lies in its holistic depiction of a paradigm shift in surveillance and state power. Analyzed together, the videos provide a multi-layered understanding that moves from the technical vector to the strategic impact. The collection serves as a critical intelligence product, documenting not just a piece of software, but the emergence of a privatized global surveillance market that provides autocratic regimes with capabilities once reserved for superpower intelligence agencies. The most significant insight is the demonstration of how this technology acts as a direct instrument of foreign policy and internal control, capable of influencing diplomatic relations, subverting the rule of law in foreign countries, and executing acts of transnational repression with terrifying efficiency. This represents a fundamental change in the global security landscape, the full implications of which are still unfolding.",
  "key_insights": [
    "The collection's information architecture reveals a deliberate, two-part investigative journalism strategy, using a core consortium of media outlets (`Le Monde`, `The Washington Post`, `The Guardian`) to establish credibility and build a serialized case around the \"Global Spyware Scandal.\" This coordinated narrative structure amplifies the message and suggests a formal partnership, likely the Pegasus Project.",
    "The most strategically significant entities delineate a clear conflict narrative: a commercial product (`Pegasus`) is the weapon, a state actor (`Hungary`) is the user, and a pillar of civil society (`Journalists`) is the target. The consistent focus on Hungary suggests it is being presented as the primary case study to illustrate a global problem.",
    "The temporal evolution of topics like \"nso group\" across a short 7-day span indicates a rapidly advancing narrative, likely moving from exposing the initial threat in the first video to attributing responsibility to its corporate enabler in the second. This sequential structure is designed to build a conclusive argument for the audience.",
    "The analysis reveals a critical strategic implication: the privatization and proliferation of state-level surveillance capabilities. The consistent connection between `Pegasus`, `Hungary`, and `Journalists` demonstrates how commercial technology is enabling state actors to easily target democratic institutions and undermine press freedom.",
    "The low entity compression ratio (0.90) combined with the high number of cross-video entities (18) indicates that while the core narrative is tightly focused, each video introduces substantial new evidence and supporting actors. This suggests a content strategy designed to deepen the investigation with fresh details rather than simply repeating a static story.",
    "Despite strong entity resolution, the analysis likely suffers from an information bias inherent in its sources (investigative media), creating critical intelligence gaps. The perspectives of the primary antagonist, `NSO Group`, and the accused state actors (`Hungary`) are likely underrepresented or absent, which is a key vulnerability in the collection's objectivity."
